<p><strong><span >ELECTRONIC AND SOFTWARE FEATURES</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Intuitive interface for ease of operation<br>2. Unique knee angle data input allows entry of desired<br>ROMs to determine seat and pedal crank settings<br>minimizing the guess work<br>3. Set-up mode allows quick entry of patient data,<br>resistance resolution, settings, and how the information is<br>displayed<br>4. Large, easy-to-read displays: Time, RPM, Watts, Calories,<br>METs, Heart Rate, Power, and much more<br>5. Multiple Programs include: Quick Start, Manual Mode,<br>Preset Hill, Plateau, and Interval profiles; Custom Facility<br>protocol program, VO2 sub-max YMCA protocol,<br>Isokinetic speed based resistance (from 25 to 100 RPM)<br>6. Unique Symmetry program that measures and displays<br>power around the pedal stroke. Biofeedback encourages<br>patients to maintain power between right and left leg</p>
<p><strong><span >TECH SPECS:-</span></strong></p>
<p>Power: 90 to 240 volts AC<br>Overall dimensions: 42.5”L x 21.5”W x 53.5”H<br>(108cm x 55cm x 136cm)<br>Net Weight: 136 lbs (62kg)<br>Max user weight: 330 lbs (150 kg)</p>
<p><span >Power train:</span></p>
<p>a. Heavy duty, 8 groove poly-v belt for smooth, quiet operation<br>b. Dual spring loaded idlers provide a low start-up resistance and forward/reverse pedaling motion<br>c. Pedal to brake ratio provides smoother pedaling motion</p>
<p><span >Braking device:</span></p>
<p>a. Electro-magnetic resistance allows for very small   increments of work- loads (5 watts per level at 60 rpm, 2 watts per level at 30 rpm).<br>b. Dual electromagnets provide a controlled isokinetic resistance and our unique Dynamic Braking mode.</p>
