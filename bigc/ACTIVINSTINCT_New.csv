Featuring fantastic technology this composite stick has a matt/gloss finish with a hand woven Italian fibre braid detailing.</p><p>Until now it had been an accepted compromise 								that extreme stiffness removed any natural absorption of shock that twisting and flexing brings resulting in less feel on the ball. Those days are gone thanks to Integrated Dampening System an anti-vibration measure. There is a piezo-electric fibre cell within the structure at the start of the handle which converts the vibration wave firstly to an undetectable electric signal and then heat energy.</p><p>DynanoTex Technology is a purification process for dry carbon fibre strands. A 24K carbon fibre strand is separated and precision tension rolled to achieve almost 80% alignment in the fibres. The result is an increase in the performance of each strand to near 100% of potential fibre strength thereby improving shear and tensile strength to reduce twisting and flexing on impact and increase the level of energy transfer through the ball.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>DynanoTex Technology</li><li>Integrated Dampening System (IDS)</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>Matt/hi-gloss combination finish</li><li>80% Carbon 20% Aramid</li></ul><br>																</div>",47036.6,2,TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick*,5,,6,N,100,TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick,By Option,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2014/m07/444834/68453975-b.jpg,-240,Buy TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick Online in India at LiveYourSport.com| Free Shipping and Massive Discounts,47036.6,12-17 Working Days,Get your hands on the TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick.
