This uniquely comfortable upper construction helps the shoe to feel perfect on your foot from the first instant with virtually zero "break-in" time.</p><p>Compared to many of the competitors the Race is designed with less heel to toe drop and a thicker forefoot with greater rebound characteristics making it extremely comfortable and fun to run in.</p><p>At the core of the shoe's design you will find Salming's unique T.G.S. 62/75 degree system which specifically designates the distance from heel to the ball of the foot (62% of the shoe) in order to optimize stability comfort and performance. Key to this design is the firmer stabilizing section which ends at the ball of the foot at the so-called "ballet" line a 75 degree angle. In front of the 75 degree line Salming have equipped the Race with a specially composed section which gives greater flexibility in order to further stimulate the foot's natural movements.</p><p>In addition this great shoe features both Salming's 5 degree angle concept on the outer edge of the shoe which helps avoid the risk of ankle injury and their innovative RollBar technology on the inner edge for quicker and better lateral push-off.</p><p>In order to help you control all of this cornering performance the XR110 outer sole has a sticky compound that provides excellent traction properties.</p>								<p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>								</div>,443438ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Racket Sports/Squash/Squash Shoes/Men's;Shoes/Men's Shoes/Indoor Court Shoes,SALMING R2 2.0 Men's Indoor Shoe,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the SALMING R2 2.0 Men's Indoor Shoe.

The Low 								Bend incorporates the maximum permitted bend but as the name suggests it is positioned lower on the shaft; 200mm from the bottom of the head.</p><p>Nano-Carbon Technology involves adding microscopic carbon straws to the bonding resins for the purpose of filling these tiny gaps which are otherwise filled only by resin. These minute hollow carbon straws within the resin provide multi-directional strength between the materials with the result being a stronger and more resistant bond and thereby increasing the overall strength of the stick.</p><p>This particular sticks sits at the very top of the range with the highest ever carbon percentage in a Mercian stick. The 001 also uses Piso-electric fibres to 'harvest' the vibrations created in a super-stiff stick and turn them into heat the result of which is efficient vibration dampening.</p><p>Sticks in the Pro-Line range have the largest cross section size. The greater cross-sectional size which increases stick strength combined with increased material density and a relatively low balance point make the new Pro-Line sticks perfect for today's top level players.</p><ul><li>Length: 36.5" / 37.5"</li><li>Weight: Light / Medium</li><li>Bend: Low</li><li>Composition: Carbon 90% Fibreglass 5% and Kevlar 5%</li></ul><br>								<p>Material</p><ul><li>Carbon </li><li>Kevlar </li><li>Fibreglass </li></ul>								</div>,374144ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,MERCIAN Pro-Line 001 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the MERCIAN Pro-Line 001 Hockey Stick.

Product,,TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick*,TK Hockey,47036.6,47036.6,40104.700155,<div id="product_description_text" style="overflow:hidden; min-height:75px;">								<p>The Platinum series the highest specification stick that TK produce. Featuring fantastic technology this composite stick has a matt/gloss finish with a hand woven Italian fibre braid detailing.</p><p>Until now it had been an accepted compromise 								that extreme stiffness removed any natural absorption of shock that twisting and flexing brings resulting in less feel on the ball. Those days are gone thanks to Integrated Dampening System an anti-vibration measure. There is a piezo-electric fibre cell within the structure at the start of the handle which converts the vibration wave firstly to an undetectable electric signal and then heat energy.</p><p>DynanoTex Technology is a purification process for dry carbon fibre strands. A 24K carbon fibre strand is separated and precision tension rolled to achieve almost 80% alignment in the fibres. The result is an increase in the performance of each strand to near 100% of potential fibre strength thereby improving shear and tensile strength to reduce twisting and flexing on impact and increase the level of energy transfer through the ball.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>DynanoTex Technology</li><li>Integrated Dampening System (IDS)</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>Matt/hi-gloss combination finish</li><li>80% Carbon 20% Aramid</li></ul><br>																</div>,444834ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Platinum P2 Hockey Stick.

To ensure you stay one step ahead Grays have introduced Carbon Nano Tube technology. Although small in size these minute sized Carbon Nano Tubes play an important part 								in taking this hockey stick to a new level and give top players that extra percent to swing the game in your favour.</p><p>The combination and integration of these Carbon Nano Tubes within the resin mix combined with Gray's special composite fibre matrix constructions on these Nano models that increases the unidirectional qualities of the sticks performance.</p><p>All of these advances combine to offer greater consistency in performance when hitting. Stability is also improved while improving feel and handling response when controlling the ball.</p><p>Increasing both the flexural strength as well as giving greater torsional stability results in a more reliable stick that also increase durability and reduces wear on synthetic pitches.</p><p>The Grays Nano 10 features a new look silver basalt style along with a fibre matrix construction formula with fully integrated carbon aramid and new basalt.</p><p>The added basalt improves control performance with enhanced energy absorption and energy transfer when hitting.</p><p>The Improved Feel Area absorbs the initial ball contact with the surface of the stick head and provides a softer feel. A special combination of shock absorbing aramid and fibreglass fibres improves first touch control and create a better feel whilst the textured finish helps give more grip and control of the ball particularly on water based surfaces.</p><p>The Jumbow blade profile is the ultimate shape and design with the curve positioned down the blade to help generate drag flick momentum.

Featuring fantastic technology this composite stick has a matt/gloss finish with a hand woven Italian fibre braid detailing.</p><p>Until now it had been an accepted compromise 								that extreme stiffness removed any natural absorption of shock that twisting and flexing brings resulting in less feel on the ball. Those days are gone thanks to Integrated Dampening System an anti-vibration measure. There is a piezo-electric fibre cell within the structure at the start of the handle which converts the vibration wave firstly to an undetectable electric signal and then heat energy.</p><p>DynanoTex Technology is a purification process for dry carbon fibre strands. A 24K carbon fibre strand is separated and precision tension rolled to achieve almost 80% alignment in the fibres. The result is an increase in the performance of each strand to near 100% of potential fibre strength thereby improving shear and tensile strength to reduce twisting and flexing on impact and increase the level of energy transfer through the ball.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>DynanoTex Technology</li><li>Integrated Dampening System (IDS)</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>Matt/hi-gloss combination finish</li><li>90% Carbon 10% Aramid</li></ul><br>																</div>,444820ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Platinum P1 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Platinum P1 Hockey Stick.

To ensure you stay one step ahead Grays have introduced Carbon Nano Tube technology. Although small in size these minute sized Carbon Nano Tubes play an important part 								in taking this hockey stick to a new level and give top players that extra percent to swing the game in your favour. They recognise it is the small things that make all the difference.</p><p>The combination and integration of these Carbon Nano Tubes within the resin mix combined with Gray's special composite fibre matrix constructions on these Nano models that increases the unidirectional qualities of the sticks performance.</p><p>All of these advances combine to offer greater consistency in performance when hitting. Stability is also improved while improving feel and handling response when controlling the ball.</p><p>Grays were inspired by a desire to take the performance of composite sticks to a new level by improving consistency and performance. Increasing both the flexural strength as well as giving greater torsional stability results in a more reliable stick that also increase durability and reduces wear on synthetic pitches. By introducing these new hi-tech Carbon Nano technologies Grays are now able to introduce and offer players the latest cutting edge technology.</p><p>Key features:</p><ul><li>New top of the range nano model</li><li>Fully integrated carbon/aramid Nano construction process</li><li>New nano weave graphics</li><li>Megabow blade profile</li></ul><br><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>Lengths: 36.5" 37.5"</li><li>Weights: L or M</li><li>Headshape: Maxi</li><li>Power rating: Xtra Stiff</li><li>Blade profile: Megabow</li><li>Reinforcement materials: Carbon Aramid</li><li>Balance points: L-36.5cm M-37.5cm</li><li>Grip: Traction Hi-Soft</li><li>Low backhand zone: Carbon X Edge Protection</li></ul><br>																</div>,446738ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,GRAYS Nano 9 Jumbow Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the GRAYS Nano 9 Jumbow Hockey Stick.

Those days are gone thanks to Integrated Dampening System an anti-vibration measure. There is a piezo-electric fibre cell within the structure at the start of the handle which converts the vibration wave firstly to an undetectable electric signal and then heat energy.</p><p>Nano Technology Construction sticks are based on a multiwall layering of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes unite carbon atoms at equal distances through a super strong carbon-carbon covalent bond to create extreme mechanical strength principally in stiffness and toughness. They are also extremely light. This technology creates very stiff and twist-resistant sticks for increased levels of response and output whilst at the same time being lighter than sticks constructed from standard composite materials.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>Nano Technology Construction</li><li>Integrated Dampening System (IDS)</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>70% Carbon 10% Aramid 20% Glassfibre</li></ul><br>																</div>,444864ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Synergy S2 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Synergy S2 Hockey Stick.

Setting NEW standards in technology advancement TK's state of the art Platinum sticks are built with a high Carbon Nano tube configuration and Zero Glass fiber Rock 								Kevlar toe reinforcement. The new highlight of the two upper level Platinum Sticks is the foam filled core a first in Hockey. Another impressive aspect of these sticks is the use of DynanoTex Spread Roving technology. This is not only a dream the technology is visible on the side of the stick a chequer board look. This is the DynanoTex Technology.</p><p>Late Bow Shape: Evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Dynanotex Reinforcement: Dynanotex is a low speading system of dry carbon fiber strands. These dry fiber strands go through a very precise process whereby the fibers are un-bundled and aligned precisely at their axes enabling them to yield 100% fiber strength. This technology maximises the sticks potential so it will perform comfortably under rough and tough playing conditions.</p><p>Nano Technology: TK's advancement into Multiwall Carbon Nano Tube architecture enhances the mechanical strength of the sticks composite struckture utilising a strong Carbon to Carbon covalent bond.

The Low 								Bend incorporates the maximum permitted bend but as the name suggests it is positioned lower on the shaft; 200mm from the bottom of the head.</p><p>Nano-Carbon Technology involves adding microscopic carbon straws to the bonding resins for the purpose of filling these tiny gaps which are otherwise filled only by resin. These minute hollow carbon straws within the resin provide multi-directional strength between the materials with the result being a stronger and more resistant bond and thereby increasing the overall strength of the stick.</p><p>This particular sticks sits at the very top of the range with the highest ever carbon percentage in a Mercian stick. The 001 also uses Piso-electric fibres to 'harvest' the vibrations created in a super-stiff stick and turn them into heat the result of which is efficient vibration dampening.</p><p>Sticks in the Pro-Line range have the largest cross section size. The greater cross-sectional size which increases stick strength combined with increased material density and a relatively low balance point make the new Pro-Line sticks perfect for today's top level players.</p><ul><li>Length: 36.5" / 37.5"</li><li>Weight: Light / Medium</li><li>Bend: Low</li><li>Composition: Carbon 90% Fibreglass 5% and Kevlar 5%</li></ul><br>																</div>,233477ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,MERCIAN Pro-Line 001 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the MERCIAN Pro-Line 001 Hockey Stick.

Carbon nanotubes unite carbon atoms at equal distances through a super strong carbon-carbon covalent bond to create extreme mechanical strength principally in stiffness and toughness. They are also extremely light. This technology creates very stiff and twist-resistant sticks for increased levels of response and output whilst at the same time being lighter than sticks constructed from standard composite materials.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>Nano Technology Construction</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>30% Carbon 10% Aramid 60% Glassfibre</li></ul><br>																</div>,444910ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Synergy S6 Yellow Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Synergy S6 Yellow Hockey Stick.

The Standard 								Bend incorporates the maximum permitted bend positioned at the mid-point of the shaft.</p><p>100-Series sticks have a shaft weighting with a balance point closer towards the handle. This gives a lighter 'feel' to the sticks making them suitable for intermediate players without the desire or need for a specific focus on stiffness and power. A thicker fibreglass skeleton than the Pro-Line is overlaid with varying percentages of carbon and Kevlar to create five different stick specifications.</p><p>All sticks in the 100-Series have a high gloss back and a high-friction hard wearing matt face. This textured face mimics that which is found on the face of a raw wooden stick and helps to reduce ball spin on water based pitches. The 100-Series offers a technical durable and price conscious solution to a majority of player's needs.</p><ul><li>Length: 36.5" / 37.5"</li><li>Weight: Light / Medium</li><li>Bend: Standard</li><li>Composition: Carbon 60% Kevlar 20% and Fibreglass 10%</li></ul><br>								<p>Material</p><ul><li>Carbon </li><li>Kevlar </li><li>Fibreglass </li></ul>								</div>,374192ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,MERCIAN 100-Series 103 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the MERCIAN 100-Series 103 Hockey Stick.

Carbon nanotubes unite carbon atoms at equal distances through a super strong carbon-carbon covalent bond to create extreme mechanical strength principally in stiffness and toughness. They are also extremely light. This technology creates very stiff and twist-resistant sticks for increased levels of response and output whilst at the same time being lighter than sticks constructed from standard composite materials.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>Nano Technology Construction</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>60% Carbon 10% Aramid 30% Glassfibre</li></ul><br>																</div>,369265ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Synergy S3 Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Synergy S3 Hockey Stick.

The Standard 								Bend incorporates the maximum permitted bend positioned at the mid-point of the shaft.</p><p>100-Series sticks have a shaft weighting with a balance point closer towards the handle. This gives a lighter 'feel' to the sticks making them suitable for intermediate players without the desire or need for a specific focus on stiffness and power. A thicker fibreglass skeleton than the Pro-Line is overlaid with varying percentages of carbon and Kevlar to create five different stick specifications.</p><p>All sticks in the 100-Series have a high gloss back and a high-friction hard wearing matt face. This textured face mimics that which is found on the face of a raw wooden stick and helps to reduce ball spin on water based pitches.

The Low 								Bend incorporates the maximum permitted bend but as the name suggests it is positioned lower on the shaft; 200mm from the bottom of the head.</p><p>100-Series sticks have a shaft weighting with a balance point closer towards the handle. This gives a lighter 'feel' to the sticks making them suitable for intermediate players without the desire or need for a specific focus on stiffness and power. A thicker fibreglass skeleton than the Pro-Line is overlaid with varying percentages of carbon and Kevlar to create five different stick specifications.</p><p>All sticks in the 100-Series have a high gloss back and a high-friction hard wearing matt face. This textured face mimics that which is found on the face of a raw wooden stick and helps to reduce ball spin on water based pitches.

Carbon nanotubes unite carbon atoms at equal distances through a super strong carbon-carbon covalent bond to create extreme mechanical strength principally in stiffness and toughness. They are also extremely light. This technology creates very stiff and twist-resistant sticks for increased levels of response and output whilst at the same time being lighter than sticks constructed from standard composite materials.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick. This shape principally aids dynamic ball control and multi-directional dribbling as well as drag flicking and aerial passing but still performs basic ball movement skills well.</p><p>Specification:</p><ul><li>Nano Technology Construction</li><li>Late Bow</li><li>30% Carbon 10% Aramid 60% Glassfibre</li></ul><br>																</div>,369286ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Team Sports/Hockey/Sticks/Adult/Composite sticks,TK Synergy S6 Black/Pink Hockey Stick,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the TK Synergy S6 Black/Pink Hockey Stick.

Carbon nanotubes unite carbon atoms at equal distances through a super strong carbon-carbon covalent bond to create extreme mechanical strength principally in stiffness and toughness. They are also extremely light. This technology creates very stiff and twist-resistant sticks for increased levels of response and output whilst at the same time being lighter than sticks constructed from standard composite materials.</p><p>The stick is evenly balanced with a 25mm bow the apex of which is moved towards the head to create greater drag force and sharper angles in the lower section of the stick.

The Viper is low with less cushioning in the forefoot area enabling a more close-to-the-court feel plus a lighter more breathable upper.</p><p>The construction has its origins 								in the Salming Running range with a three-layer system and the unique ExoSkeleton that keeps the foot in the right position during lateral movements.</p><p>The unique T.G.S 62/72 system specifically designates the distance from the heel to the ball of the foot (62% of the shoe) in order to optimise stability comfort and performance. Key to this design is the firmer stabilising section which ends at the ball of the foot at the so-called ballet line (a 75 degree angle).</p><p>The midsole features a special high abrasion injection EVA; RunLite designed to create a nice feel for the court. It is light and responds excellently to the floor surface.</p>								<p>Material</p><ul><li>Synthetic Material </li><li>Waterproof Breathable Membrane </li></ul>								</div>,503815ACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Racket Sports/Squash/Squash Shoes/Women's;Shoes/Women's Shoes/Indoor Court Shoes,SALMING Viper 2.0 Ladies Indoor Shoe,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the SALMING Viper 2.0 Ladies Indoor Shoe.

The shoe's upper is made from a durable lightweight polyester fabric which is then 								covered in a special black exo skeleton that effectively helps keep the foot in the right position during lateral movements and high performance activities. This uniquely comfortable upper construction helps the shoe to feel perfect on your foot from the first instant with virtually zero "break-in" time.</p><p>Compared to many of the competitors the Race is designed with less heel to toe drop and a thicker forefoot with greater rebound characteristics making it extremely comfortable and fun to run in.</p><p>At the core of the shoe's design you will find Salming's unique T.G.S. 62/75 degree system which specifically designates the distance from heel to the ball of the foot (62% of the shoe) in order to optimize stability comfort and performance. Key to this design is the firmer stabilizing section which ends at the ball of the foot at the so-called "ballet" line a 75 degree angle. In front of the 75 degree line Salming have equipped the Race with a specially composed section which gives greater flexibility in order to further stimulate the foot's natural movements.</p><p>In addition this great shoe features both Salming's 5 degree angle concept on the outer edge of the shoe which helps avoid the risk of ankle injury and their innovative RollBar technology on the inner edge for quicker and better lateral push-off.</p><p>In order to help you control all of this cornering performance the XR110 outer sole has a sticky compound that provides excellent traction properties.</p>								<p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>								</div>,s Indoor ShoeACVIN,ACTIVINSTINCT,Racket Sports/Squash/Squash Shoes/Men's;Shoes/Men's Shoes/Indoor Court Shoes,SALMING R9 Mid Men's Indoor Shoe,12-17 Working Days,100,N,-240,Get your hands on the SALMING R9 Mid Men's Indoor Shoe.
