Handy chinstrap lets you secure it on your head or wear it on your back when indoors.
Grosgrain sweatband adds comfort and wicking.
The lightweight palm material cleans easily, dries quickly and it floats!
The Beach Hat fits a hat size of 7 measuring 22"".
All Tula hats have been tested by California Polytechnic State University and were awarded the 50+ UPF rating, the highest possible for sun protective gear.
Reshaping is as simple as a water spritz and re-sizing as easy as a trip to the hardware store! Tula recommends cutting 3/4"" poly foam water seal (at a hardware store near you) into 4-6"" long strips and placing them behind the sweatband for a more secure fit.

The Princeton Tec Fuel Headlamp's LEDs throw out lots of light while giving you up to 160 hours of battery life. 

A simple push button switches the three Ultrabright LEDs to give you four light settings - high, high/flash, medium and low. 
On the high setting the bright light reaches out over 65 feet. 
Battery life in hours is: high - 74, flash - 134, medium - 120 and low - 164. 
Three AAA alkaline batteries (included) are quickly inserted in the clip lock, water resistant battery housing. 
With the batteries, the Fuel weighs a mere 2.75 ounces! 
The mounting bracket adjusts up or down to let you direct the light where you need it - from the distance, to the book in your lap.
The comfortable elastic head band holds the light firmly in place and easily adjusts to length.

                    The Princeton Tec EOS Headlamp is optimal for localized needs and spotting at a distance.
Three brightness levels and a safety blinking mode.
Up to 121 hours burntime on included AAA batteries.

The powerful Maxbright 1-watt LED can reach out 150 feet on High setting and also give great near range lighting on the lower settings.
The advanced Princeton Tec lens/collimator design is what gives you long, mid and short distance lighting with just one LED.
What's a collimator, do you ask? It's a device to change a light point source to a parallel beam. The unique EOS narrows and widens that beam at the click of the switch.
The Constant Brightness feature regulates the light intensity as long as the batteries have sufficient voltage.
Large switch cycles between the four modes - high, medium, low and blink.
Head tilts for optimum light angle.
Waterproof down to one meter.

This reusable tote scrunches into the size of a baseball! A bungee closure with adjustable barrel-lock makes the Jenni Bag its own stuff sack.
Ripstop fabric is lightweight, durable, quick-drying, highly compactable and completely no-fuss.
21"" long and 14"" high, this bag has room for all the essentials, and the extras too.
3.5"" x 5"" inner pouch with hook-and-loop closure is the perfect spot for keys, cash and, yes, lip balm.
Two wide double-reinforced carrying straps work equally well over the shoulder or in the hand.

                    The Women's Aurora Pull-on is all new for Spring 2011. It is a lightweight, stretch fit, half zip top that offers protection from sun and elements.

The Aurora offers UPF 50+ protection, a venting chest zip, a single concealed pocket for small items and a hood that fits neatly under a helmet. The fabric offers some wind protection but not at the expense of breathability - the Aurora having an unashamedly warm weather bias! perfect for those long summer days at the crag with the temperature in the high 30's  . . .  (or did we dream those?)
The Rab Aurora Pull-on (on its launch in 2011) was awarded a coveted Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award.
 
New for 2013 the Aurora gets a new hidden addition - Polygiene Anti-bacterial treatment. This basically means that you can wear the Aurora for longer between washes (without offedning those around you..)

MeCo baselayers consist of 65% merino wool blended with 35% Cocona Polyester. This version (as the name suggests) uses a 250gsm fabric that offers more warmth than the lighter MeCo fabrics but still offers the same fast drying and anti odour properties.
The MeCo 250 can be worn as a winter weight base layer or we've found it also works really well as a light midlayer especially for multi day trips when the anti odour and quick drying properties really shine through.

                    The Neutrino Endurance is a lightweight, fully featured and very warm down jacket designed primarily for climbing and mountain use.
The Neutrino Endurance has become the benchmark down jacket for modern mountaineering and lightweight ascents. The Pertex® Endurance outer provides durable protection against storm and spindrift while retaining minimal weight and packsize. High lofting is provided by the 225g of 800 fill (L) pure European goose down.
The Neutrino Endurance is one of those jackets that just does everything you need it to - a firm favourite amongst all our sponsored athletes and an ideal piece for UK and Alpine winter conditions. Just as much at home on a hill walk in the Peak District as it is on a Himalayan Peak. Often found at winter fell race finish lines or on your 'spotter' when going for the crux on a new boulder problem.

                    The Orbit Pull-on is a lightweight Polartec 100, half zip microfleece top with a micro stripe pattern.
A simple pull over style in two-tone contrast fabric makes this top ideal for use both on and off the hill. A great alternative to cotton pull-overs as it dries so quickly and offers much greater warmth for weight.
Technical features include a quality YKK chest zip and flatlock seams for improved comfort.

                    The Boulder Pull-On is a lightweight, highly insulating fleece pull-over using hi-loft Polartec® Thermal Pro® in a light weight format.
The Pull-on provides fantastic warmth to weight ratio and is an ideal layering piece under your waterproof shell. The deep pile make up of the fabric means that it is 20% warmer than standard fleece and 40% more compressible.
The hi loft nature of the fabric does mean it is susceptible to wind passing through - but this also means that it is supremely breathable, making it the ideal fleece layering piece for year round use.
