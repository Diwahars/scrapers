							<p>The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts bring the benefits of their medical-grade compression to the</p>
<p>widest audience yet. Whatever your sport or physical activity, these shorts deliver optimum</p>
<p>compression to the thighs in total comfort.</p>

<p>The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts are designed to be worn underneath regular shorts or kit and are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate</p>
<p>targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and</p>
<p>reduces muscle vibration.</p>

<p>Targeted Compression: the seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.</p>

<p>Waistband: the Jacquard elastic waistband is designed for comfort and has silicone grip inside to keep the shorts in position.</p>

<p>Push-Up Zone: the shorts provide exceptional support to the groin area while offering maximum freedom of movement and comfort. The Push-Up Zone is woven from 100% pure natural fibres: cashmere is thermo-regulatory; copper has antifungal and antibacterial properties to prevent odours and irritation of the mucous membranes; soft wood pulp is highly absorbent and breathable.</p>

<p>Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and</p>
<p>discreet, they avoid chafing.</p>

<p>Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.</p>

<p>Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.</p>

<p>Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.</p>

<p>Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance</p>
<p>between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.</p>

<p>Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.</p>

<p>OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection</p>
<p>certificate, declaring that it contains no chemical substances harmful to the skin.</p>

							<p>ZERO Neutral electrolyte tabs let you take control of your sports drink. With no flavour or sweetness, simply drop a tab into water, Supermarket cordial or diluted juice to create a low calorie sports drink of your own design with a wide variety of favourite flavours.

							<p>Using the same patented unique rigid air technology as IGOAL the newly launched ILITE offers easy to use portable floodlighting. With no need for any bulky or heavy wiring or generators, this can be simply carried in its bag to where you need it thanks to its lightweight nature. You can even use the hand held lighting house as a torch to guide your way.</p>

<p>The IP66 protected LED unit is designed for greater durability and reliability, giving more light coverage than a 300W halogen floodlight, while working off re-chargeable low 12 volt system that gives over 3 hours use from the fully charged battery.

							<p>WHEY ISOLATE is a high-purity and very readily available whey protein isolate that is obtained by means of an ion exchange process and has a high biological value because of its high essential amino acid content. Consumption of whey protein leads to the greatest muscle building compared to consumption of casein or soy alone, mainly down to the different rates of digestion. Compared to soy, and especially compared to casein, whey is digested faster and is therefore made available to the muscles sooner. An additional benefit is the high quantity of the signal effective amino acid L-LEUCINE; this stimulates the formation of muscle protein.</p>

<p>If WHEY ISOLATE is taken immediately after training when the body's metabolism processes are running at full speed, these processes can be used efficiently to create accelerating effects. These effects include quick recovery, improved absorption of amino acids by the muscles, faster repair of worn-out muscle cells and more effective formation of new muscle protein.</p>

							<p>The original recovery formulation, use REGO Recovery to maximise your muscles recovery and get you back out exercising quickly with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>Performance Proven REGO is a Re-Energising energy Fuel with micro-nutrients to improve recovery and boost adaptation to exercise.</p>

<p>REGO combines a special mix of complex carbohydrates, fructose and protein, which has been shown to give a rapid improvement in recovery from hard exercise. REGO is the ideal post exercise drink and is especially useful after hard training sessions. REGO was inspired by Chris Boardman who had experimented mixing carbohydrate energy drink (PSP22) with protein powder. REGO has been used by him, and many other top athletes and sportsmen since its launch in 1995.</p>

<p>REGO is the world's first integrated protein system, which utilises the absorption characteristics of different proteins in order to maximize training gains.</p>

<p>Typical Ingredients</p>

<p>Maltodextrin (produced by partial hydrolysis of a special variety of maize, 98% glucose polymers), Soya Protein Isolate, Fructose, Vitamins and Minerals, Xanthan, Lecithin, Natural Flavour and Colouring, Aspartame.</p>

							<p>Caffeine stimulation which is easy to swallow, Science in Sport GO-Caffeine combines our unique Science in Sport gel technology to deliver energy, with a whole host of extras.</p>

<p>This offers a caffeine kick, which helps the blood flow more easily, down even the smallest capillaries, delivering more nutrients and stimulation to active muscles.</p>

<p>Science in Sport GO-Caffeine contains blackcurrant anthocyanins, a potent antioxidant, for improved night vision, perfect for drivers and night events. High caffeine levels are often associated with a blurring of vision and these anthocyanins help reduce this. Also present are citrus bioflavenoids, another powerful antioxidant, which have been shown to improve caffeine absorption, and work synergistically with the other antioxidants.</p>

<p>Together these functional ingredients will improve blood flow, protect against oxidative stress, improve night vision, improve alertness and reduce cramp and muscle strain.</p>

<p>This is all based on award winning Science in Sport gel technology, so you get a rapidly absorbed carbohydrate energy boost.</p>

							<p>The fast-build protein formula for athletes. Ideal as a daytime muscle growth complex or as a pre-workout protein boost. Fast proteins (whey isolate, whey hydrolysate, wheat protein hydrolysate) deliver a big shot of nutrition when your body needs it in a triple fast protein blend with a structured amino acid profile. Taken between meals, SiS REGO Protein powder helps increase protein turnover throughout the day and so maximises training gains.</p>

<p>Uses: Take prior to resistance workouts, use between meals to boost protein synthesis or use with meals to boost protein content.</p>

<p>Do not take SiS REGO Protein powder prior to bed time, as fast proteins can increase protein catabolism (muscle breakdown) over an 8 hour fast (you can use SiS REGO Night instead) which is designed to slowly drip feed proteins overnight to help avoid muscle breakdown.</p>

<p>SiS REGO Protein powder is part of the protein kinetics system, which utilizes the absorption characteristics of different proteins in order to maximize training gains.</p>

<p>The Protein Kinetics System was developed from studies using the latest research techniques that look beyond nitrogen balance and absolute nitrogen supply, to focus on absorption speed and protein turnover. Science in Sport has identified specific protein fragments that have different kinetic profiles, and incorporated them into this product.</p>

							<p>SiS GO Hydro is the next wave in sports hydration, for all your fluid and hydration needs, with virtually no calories - only 7.5 kcal per serving.</p>

<p>SiS GO Hydro was developed in conjunction with the Skandia Team GBR for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. Its effectiveness has been proven by elite athletes and is now used as part of their ritual.</p>

<p>Benefits of sodium:</p>
<p>Low hydration can lower performance, so for effective rehydration a drink must provide a balance between its palatability and its sodium concentration. This is because sodium promotes fluid intake and so helps drive rehydration</p>

<p>SiS GO Hydro has been formulated to provide 30mmol solution of sodium as well as other electrolytes for optimal hydration.</p>

<p>SiS GO Hydro contains 'superfood' antioxidants and natural flavourings.</p>

<p>SiS GO Hydro also includes either elderberry anthocycanins (with berry flavour) or green tea antioxidants (with lemon flavour) which both help protect against damage from oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Each SiS GO Hydro tube contains effervescent tablets to make 20 4g tabs, which each make a 500ml serving. Very convenient to use &amp; easy to carry.</p>

<p>GO HYDRO Lemon Flavour</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

							<p>GO L-Carnitine was originally conceived as training development nutrition for the elite cyclists and teams that use Science in Sport products. It rapidly became the choice of elite athletes, with professional cyclists using them to help win some of the toughest cycle races on the planet. The large demand from all levels of sportspeople ensured it was added it to the Science in Sport range.</p>

<p>Each GO L-Carnitine contains 1g of carnitine (roughly the equivalent to the amount in 1kg of steak), and uses Science in Sport gel technology in conjunction with an innovative nutrient environment. This helps aid signalling and helps optimise the carnitine effect, while the tablet also includes potent anti-oxidants and a great taste.</p>

<p>Carnitine performs a number of important roles in the body. It is necessary for the movement of free fatty acids for fat burning in mitochondria, has a long history of use by endurance athletes and is an important nutrient, so much so that it is compulsory in infant formula.</p>

							<p>This product was developed to give your body a helping hand to cope with the additional stress of strenuous exercise. Unlike high calorie protein and carbohydrate replenishment products which you consume after exercise to aid recovery and rebuild muscle, this product aims to reduce unnecessary total body inflammation during strenuous exercise.</p>

<p>The product contains Fruitflow which is a tomato extract containing naturally occurring tomato compounds which can beneficially interact with blood platelets. Supported by human clinical trials Fruitflow is the first natural ingredient with a scientifically approved health claim to contribute to healthy blood flow.</p>

<p>In order to improve you need to train hard. The frequency and quality of your training is reliant on how quickly you can recover from the damage and inflammation caused by training and competing. Shorter recovery times mean that you can train harder or compete faster next time.</p>

<p>The pain you feel during recovery is from muscle inflammation, which is good as this is part of the adaptation process, however intense training over-stimulates blood platelets which can cause additional and unnecessary inflammatory stress throughout your body. SiS REGO + Fruitflow gel will help reduce over-stimulation of blood platelets during intense exercise, reducing inflammation, which in turn can shorten recovery times.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>
