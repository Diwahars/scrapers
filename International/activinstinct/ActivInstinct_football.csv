							ZERO is the new sugar free electrolyte drink from High5. The drink is virtually calorie free (Energy 0.23Kcal per 100ml when mixed 1 tablet per 750ml) and has a light refreshing taste.

ZERO is naturally free from preservatives, allergens, artificial colours and flavours. Scientific research at the Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow found that simply drinking ZERO instead of a normal carbohydrate sport drink participants burned on average 41% more fat during exercise.

This is an incredibly easy product to use, drop a tablet in your bottle and it quickly dissolves in water to give you a delicious, refreshing, advanced electrolyte drink with added magnesium. The small recyclable tube contains 20 tablets and makes 15 litres of drink in your own reusable sports bottle, which means optimal hydration while being environmentally friendly also.

As cramp can happen as a result of dehydration, electrolyte deficits, and muscle fatigue, ZERO can be an essential part of your anti cramp strategy as it contains key electrolytes; sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. ZERO is perfect for anyone who wants to stay active and hydrated, whether it being running, triathlon, team sports or whatever takes your fancy.

							The fast-build protein formula for athletes. Ideal as a daytime muscle growth complex or as a pre-workout protein boost. Fast proteins (whey isolate, whey hydrolysate, wheat protein hydrolysate) deliver a big shot of nutrition when your body needs it in a triple fast protein blend with a structured amino acid profile. Taken between meals, SiS REGO Protein powder helps increase protein turnover throughout the day and so maximises training gains.

Uses: Take prior to resistance workouts, use between meals to boost protein synthesis or use with meals to boost protein content.

Do not take SiS REGO Protein powder prior to bed time, as fast proteins can increase protein catabolism (muscle breakdown) over an 8 hour fast (you can use SiS REGO Night instead) which is designed to slowly drip feed proteins overnight to help avoid muscle breakdown.

SiS REGO Protein powder is part of the protein kinetics system, which utilizes the absorption characteristics of different proteins in order to maximize training gains.

The Protein Kinetics System was developed from studies using the latest research techniques that look beyond nitrogen balance and absolute nitrogen supply, to focus on absorption speed and protein turnover. Science in Sport has identified specific protein fragments that have different kinetic profiles, and incorporated them into this product.

							The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts bring the benefits of their medical-grade compression to the
widest audience yet. Whatever your sport or physical activity, these shorts deliver optimum
compression to the thighs in total comfort.

The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts are designed to be worn underneath regular shorts or kit and are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate
targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and
reduces muscle vibration.

Targeted Compression: the seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.

Waistband: the Jacquard elastic waistband is designed for comfort and has silicone grip inside to keep the shorts in position.

Push-Up Zone: the shorts provide exceptional support to the groin area while offering maximum freedom of movement and comfort. The Push-Up Zone is woven from 100% pure natural fibres: cashmere is thermo-regulatory; copper has antifungal and antibacterial properties to prevent odours and irritation of the mucous membranes; soft wood pulp is highly absorbent and breathable.

Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and
discreet, they avoid chafing.

Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.

Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.

Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.

Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance
between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.

Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.

Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.

OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection
certificate, declaring that it contains no chemical substances harmful to the skin.

Quality Guarantee: Compressport guarantees your product for two years and will exchange it for any manufacturing fault or defect during that period.

							Designed for training and race conditions, these Ultimate Race Fuel sachets can easily be taken with for that extra pep while you compete. Refreshingly light in flavour, these are designed to taste as your body wants during training and racing.

Scientifically formulated, Nectar delivers a DUAL CARB source: two parts glucose, one part Fructose, providing up to 55% more energy to muscles than standard energy formulations made from Glucose only.

The limiting factor in how fast the body can transport energy into the bloodstream and therefore how quickly it reaches the muscles is how quickly it can be absorbed. Glucose and Fructose, both energy molecules, use different transporters and therefore can be absorbed at the same time increasing the amount of energy entering the bloodstream by up to 55%.

Dehydration over 2% can lead to impaired performance, and if it reaches more than 5% performance can be reduced by up to 30%. The body removes heat by sweating to regulate the body's core temperature, but the more you sweat, the more you dehydrate. And it isn't just fluids that are lost in sweat-critical salts, electrolytes are lost too. Replacing these is vital to ensure your body maintains optimum hydration levels.

Each 50ml sachet should be mixed with 1000ml of water or fluid.

							ZERO Neutral electrolyte tabs let you take control of your sports drink. With no flavour or sweetness, simply drop a tab into water, Supermarket cordial or diluted juice to create a low calorie sports drink of your own design with a wide variety of favourite flavours.

Vitamin C in ZERO Neutral supports a healthy immune system, protects the cells from oxidative stress and contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Magnesium in ZERO Neutral contributes to electrolyte balance, reduces tiredness and fatigue, whilst supporting muscle protein synthesis.

The 20 tab tube can be added to 15 litres of drink, so it's great value for money. With minimal packaging, Zero is environmentally friendly and easy to keep with you.

							GO L-Carnitine was originally conceived as training development nutrition for the elite cyclists and teams that use Science in Sport products. It rapidly became the choice of elite athletes, with professional cyclists using them to help win some of the toughest cycle races on the planet. The large demand from all levels of sportspeople ensured it was added it to the Science in Sport range.

Each GO L-Carnitine contains 1g of carnitine (roughly the equivalent to the amount in 1kg of steak), and uses Science in Sport gel technology in conjunction with an innovative nutrient environment. This helps aid signalling and helps optimise the carnitine effect, while the tablet also includes potent anti-oxidants and a great taste.

Carnitine performs a number of important roles in the body. It is necessary for the movement of free fatty acids for fat burning in mitochondria, has a long history of use by endurance athletes and is an important nutrient, so much so that it is compulsory in infant formula.

							This product was developed to give your body a helping hand to cope with the additional stress of strenuous exercise. Unlike high calorie protein and carbohydrate replenishment products which you consume after exercise to aid recovery and rebuild muscle, this product aims to reduce unnecessary total body inflammation during strenuous exercise.

The product contains Fruitflow which is a tomato extract containing naturally occurring tomato compounds which can beneficially interact with blood platelets. Supported by human clinical trials Fruitflow is the first natural ingredient with a scientifically approved health claim to contribute to healthy blood flow.

In order to improve you need to train hard. The frequency and quality of your training is reliant on how quickly you can recover from the damage and inflammation caused by training and competing. Shorter recovery times mean that you can train harder or compete faster next time.

The pain you feel during recovery is from muscle inflammation, which is good as this is part of the adaptation process, however intense training over-stimulates blood platelets which can cause additional and unnecessary inflammatory stress throughout your body. SiS REGO + Fruitflow gel will help reduce over-stimulation of blood platelets during intense exercise, reducing inflammation, which in turn can shorten recovery times.

							The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.

GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.

FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.

The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.

Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.

The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.
