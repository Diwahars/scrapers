							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activites.

The lenses themselves are made from Grilamid TR-90; a homopolyamide nylon characterized by an extremely high alternative bending strength, low density, and high resistance to chemical and UV damage.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

There is ventilation to increase the airflow and reduce fogging, and the adjustable temples top this pair off, allowing for a customizable fit and increased wearing comfort.

With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.

The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.

							Compression garments enhance performance, delay fatigue, lower the risk of injury and speed up
recovery times. Based on fabrics and technology originally developed for medical compression products, they help to eliminate muscle and joint pain by supporting the muscles and reducing shock and vibrations.

The Compressport US calf guard is uniquely enhanced through the integration of a layer of 220 silicon gel buds surrounding the interior of the guard above the ankle. This optimises shock absorption, greatly reduces muscle oscillation and provides increased support to the Achilles tendon.

After exercise the Compressport US calf guard boosts your venous return, reducing the accumulation of toxins while increasing oxygenation to the muscles. The reduction in lactic acid build-up coupled with its shock absorption properties protects you from muscular fatigue and damage.

Muscles benefit from improved oxygenation, helping to reduce the possibility of cramps and injuries. The Compressport fabric also optimises heat exchange and wicks away moisture, helping to regulate your body temperature.

							The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts bring the benefits of their medical-grade compression to the
widest audience yet. Whatever your sport or physical activity, these shorts deliver optimum
compression to the thighs in total comfort.

The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts are designed to be worn underneath regular shorts or kit and are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate
targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and
reduces muscle vibration.

Targeted Compression: the seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.

Waistband: the Jacquard elastic waistband is designed for comfort and has silicone grip inside to keep the shorts in position.

Push-Up Zone: the shorts provide exceptional support to the groin area while offering maximum freedom of movement and comfort. The Push-Up Zone is woven from 100% pure natural fibres: cashmere is thermo-regulatory; copper has antifungal and antibacterial properties to prevent odours and irritation of the mucous membranes; soft wood pulp is highly absorbent and breathable.

Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and
discreet, they avoid chafing.

Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.

Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.

Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.

Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance
between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.

Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.

Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.

OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection
certificate, declaring that it contains no chemical substances harmful to the skin.

Quality Guarantee: Compressport guarantees your product for two years and will exchange it for any manufacturing fault or defect during that period.

The internal construction of Barefit technology puts Zoot seamless technologies closest to the foot, for exceptional internal feel and long-distance comfort.

It utilises Z-bound technology in the midsole. This consists of a lightweight and resilient compound, responsible for the responsive ride. Z-bound has a very high-energy return and so the result is less weight and great response.

The CarbonSpan Plus shank is lighter, stronger, and tuned to your running. It provides a smooth powerful toe off in the way that plastic would fail to do so.

To add to all this, the Zoot Ultra Fit Upper is a compression-like upper used on all Zoot footwear, and this is no different. It gives the shoes an extremely comfortable fit that hugs your foot, meaning less clutter, a better fit, and more comfortable feet.

							Skins COLDBLACK Men's Half Tights utilise Coldblack treatment to reduce the absorption and reflection of the sun's rays meaning that the fabric heats up less and stays cooler by up to 5 degrees Celsius.

More oxygen to your muscles: Dynamic gradient compression gets more oxygen filled blood to your active muscles for increased power and stamina

More Control: Memory MX fabric maximises your stability and control while channeling the direction of your core muscles

Recover quicker: Less lactic acid build-up, less muscle vibration and less pain in the morning
Also features integrated key/coin pocket and an ergonomic waistband that moves when you do without flipping or rolling.

400 Fit: A super comfortable fit, more precise, targeted Gradient Compression and in some cases, a greater range of leg lengths for men and different body shapes for women.
50+ UV Protection: SKINS was born in Australia, so we know a thing or two about exerting ourselves in the sun. Our fabrics have a UV protection of 50+, which means you can get out and train harder without worrying about the sun related risks.

Dynamic Gradient Compression: Increases oxygen delivery to active muscles while in motion and reduces lactic-acid build-up for more power and less recovery time.

Memory MX: Memory MX fabric contains a unique high stretch elastomeric yarn â"" which returns to its original shape no matter how much stress you put it under.
Moisture Management: Keeping you dry through advanced wicking is inherent in all SKINS fabrics - moisture is drawn away from your skin, so you stay dry and comfortable.

Muscle Focus: Uniquely wrapping and supporting your key muscle groups to reduce movement and focus direction for less vibration in your muscles, less soft tissue damage and less soreness after exercise.

Warp Knit: The fabric in SKINS is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to give superior performance - Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch â"" instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression.

							The Triathlon is one of mankind's greatest endurance tests. With the trinity of swimming, cycling and running, both body and mind are pushed to their limits, demanding a supremely tough athlete - and an equally enduring garment. If you prefer a two-piece racing suit over a full-length suit, the Compression Tri Short is engineered to give you a competitive advantage on the run, ride and the swim.

The new Skins TRI400 series is cut for comfort while swimming, cycling and running and are the only high performance triathlon apparel to use in-motion measurement to define the correct levels of compression on the right muscles, just when you need it.

Strategically placed panels of heat-treated Toray fabric, with a sleek surface texture, minimise drag and aid performance on the swim. A Memory MX Triweb panel down the spine and around the obliques helps prove unrestricted movement.

At the centre of triathlon performance is the chamois, ideal for performance on the ride. This garment features a triathlon-specific Elastic Interface Technology men's chamois that's the result of thousands of hours of engineering and testing.

Last but no least, carbon-infused fabric on the inside of the leg of the suit and shorts means 40% less friction as you run, for enhanced comfort and performance. Full coverage of the thigh muscles provides support to help improve endurance in the final stage of the race, to get you there first and ready to go again.

							The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.

GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.

FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.

The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.

Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.

The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.

The Skins A200 Series collection for women was designed by women for women so the garments feature flattering lines to give you a sleek silhouette as well as this season?s hottest colours.MaterialNylon 85%Spandex 15%						",8299,9709.83,SKINS A200 Ladies Thermal Tights,SKINS,,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/246804/51825417-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							AfterShokz Bluez open ear wireless headphones combine the convenience, reliability and performance of Bluetooth wireless connectivity with the comfort and safety of open ear bone conduction technology to provide consumers with an entirely new way to stay connected. Unlike conventional Bluetooth headphones and earbuds that use the eardrums to transmit sound, Aftershokz Bluez headphones utilize patent pending bone conduction technology to deliver sound through the listener's cheekbones to the inner ear. This enables anyone using them to make/take phone calls and stay connected to both what they are listening to and the outside world - from warning sounds outdoors while walking or driving to a nearby colleague in an office setting.

Most bluetooth devices are designed for use in one ear, but AfterShokz Bluez sit comfortably in front of the ears and provide listeners with a stereophonic sound experience. The innovative and elegantly simple design of AfterShokz Bluez open ear headphones is built around a beautifully designed, highly ergonomic, extremely stable, one-piece warparound headband. The open ear design and the light weight of AfterShokz Bluez make them extremely comfortable and stable, even when used over extended periods of time.

AfterShokz Bluez open ear wireless bluetooth headphones deliver the safest and most comfortable way of staying connected on the planet.

							For active exercisers who are serious about training hard, the FT40 offers clear guidance to monitor fitness levels and help you to maximise your training.
The Polar FT40 is packed with features to enhance your training including an EnergyPointer that determines if the main effect of your training is fitness improvement or fat burning. The Polar Fitness test measures your aerobic fitness at rest and tells you your progress and also displays the calories you've burned.
Comes with comfortable textile transmitter and coded heart rate transmission to avoid cross-talk as well as visual and audible alarms when you're pushing too hard.

Delve deeper into the features:
Measure your heart rate and define target zones suited to your training. In Polar software or during strength training, heart rate can be displayed as a graphical trend, visually indicating the measurement of the work your heart does throughout exercise. Achieve the optimum intensity by setting targets based on your heart rate; when you're pushing too hard and are out of your preset zones, the training computer gives you a visual and audible alarm. You can set the target zone for your training as beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, or as a percentage of your heart rate reserve (HRR%).

EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature that allows you to achieve the optimum balance between improving fitness and burning fat. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.

Once you're race ready, you can also put yourself to the test by taking the Polar Fitness Test that measures your aerobic fitness at rest in just five minutes. The test is based on heart rate and heart rate variability at rest combined with personal information and the results can be broken down to give you total control.
Other essentials while exercising include Polar OwnCal, which calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training and Polar OwnCode, a coded transmission that picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only and prevents interference from other training computers.

The Polar FT40 keeps all of your training in memory helping you towards your long-term goals. A weekly history gathers your weekly training data while all of this information can be aggregated to keep you on track during the workout.
Once you hit your peak, the press of a button locks you to that zone and combines with the ZonePointer to monitor and alert you when you're falling short or exceeding it. HeartTouch is also incorporated for button free operation of wrist unit, leaving you to concentrate on reaching your goals.

							For ambitious cyclists, seeking improved cycling performance, the Polar CS500 presents the ultimate functional design for the ride. Take your training to the limits with daily personal heart rate target zones that optimize training, quick and safe control courtesy of the a rocker switch and oversized user-configurable display and complimented by altitude measurement that displays the inclines and declines of your ride.
The Polar CS500 also guarantees interference-free transmission courtesy of W.I.N.D technology.
Full features:

Your cycling cadence stands for your pedaling rate in revolutions per minute (rpm). Cadence is the central factor in improving cycling performance. A higher cadence reduces the force needed for each pedal stroke, and thus improves overall performance. Running cadence measures how many times your either right or left foot hits the ground in one minute. Running cadence is measured as steps per minute. With this feature you can sharpen your cadence and make your ground contact time shorter. This will help you to find a balance between leg power and leg speed.
Altitude is measured with an atmospheric air pressure sensor and shown as ascended and descended meters/feet and uphill/downhill steepness in percentages and grades.
An automatic age-based target zone helps you train safely and effectively, determining your heart rate target zone limits automatically according to your age-based maximum heart rate (220 minus age).

Heart rate is the measurement of the work your heart does. The CS500 allows you to set intensity targets in a number of ways and get a visual or audible alarm when you go outside of those present zones. Training targets can be defined by heart rate or set manually, as beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, or as a percentage of your heart rate reserve (HRR%).

Polar OwnZone determines your personal heart rate limits for a training session. Depending on the day and time, your physical state may vary, for instance, if you are stressed or tired, or if you are not fully recovered from your latest training session, Polar can determine that information from your heart rate and guide you to your ideal training zone for that moment.

To ensure you also stay healthy and in shape, Polar OwnCal calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training. This feature allows you to follow the kilocalories expended during one training session and cumulative kilocalories expended during several training sessions.

The transmission in the CS500 is coded and automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only, thereby significantly reducing interference from other training computers.

Follow your training load and recovery in the online training diary. Continuous monitoring of training load and recovery will help you recognize personal limits, avoid over or under-training, and adjust training intensity and duration according to your daily and weekly targets. For cycling specific training you can define settings up to two or three bikes in your training computer, a weekly history gathers your weekly training data for analysis while totals tracks all your training data from the last reset so you can also measure your long-term goals.

							The RCX5 is for triathletes, runners, cyclists and endurance athletes who want to optimize their training.

This Run version of the monitor is different to the Bike version and standard version in that it includes the s3+ stride sensor. Some of the features of this include the following:


Measures average stride length. Runners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length increases as speed increases. Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride length is the natural one; the one that feels most comfortable.
Running cadence measures how many times either your right or left foot hits the ground in one minute. Running cadence is measured as steps per minute. With this feature you can sharpen your cadence and make your ground contact time shorter. This will help you to find a balance between leg power and leg speed.
Race Pace allows you to set a target speed/pace for a certain distance. It then helps pacing the run or ride by showing the current speed/pace and by telling in time, how much you are behind or ahead of the set target.
Running Index is based on heart rate and speed data measured during the run. It gives daily information about your performance level, both aerobic fitness and running economy. Improvement in running efficiency indicates improved economy of running performance.

As well as these features, there are also some more generic features common with all RCX5 models.

							SuperMagneto Pro combines versatility with an authentic road-like feel. Between seasons, use our SuperMagneto Pro to get in great shape and stay that way. It offers the most versatility of CycleOps trainers. You can adjust the resistance curves to fit a conditioned rider or a less physically fit rider. Or modify the curves to fi t a big or small rider. And if you plan to share a trainer with another rider, the SuperMagneto Pro is the right choice.


Power curve for every rider type and ride type in one trainer
Flexible Power Curve Technology lets you adjust resistance curves, providing the right inertia for the right rider
PowerTuned technology provides smooth realistic accelerations and inertia for real-world feel
Easier transport without sacrificing ride feel or inertia

Choose a resistance curve and start riding. Tailor your workout with the SuperMagneto Pro Trainer. It offers four resistance curves: easy, road, interval and mountain. No matter how modest or ambitious your goals, this versatile trainer can help you reach them.

EASY SETTING: Warm up before you ride hard.

ROAD SETTING: Ride all day to build volume and build a sweat.

INTERVAL SETTING: Step up to a more intense workout.

MOUNTAIN SETTING: Take on the trainer's most challenging ride.

Each setting allows the unit's four rare earth magnets to move to a different controlled working diameter as centrifugal force pushes them away from the centre. The farther away the magnet is from centre, the higher the resistance. Spring-loaded magnets create a more desirable progressive resistance power curve.

Pre-Assembled: Use your trainer right out of the box and store it in a small space.

Unsurpassed Stability and Durability: Ride on an exceptionally stable platform during even the most intense training.

Handy Single-Leg Leveling Adjustment: Adjust just one leg for riding on all surfaces.

Convenient Skewer Clamp: Centre your bike from just one side and hold it securely. *Ensure to engage secondary locking feature.

Big Wheels, Too: Mount 29ers using two-position mounting bracket.

							If it's important to you to make every workout count, the CycleOps Fluid2 trainer is the most valuable weapon you can add to your indoor training arsenal.

CycleOps? engineers designed the Fluid2 to capture real road feel through the use of a 2.75 lb individually precision?balanced flywheel for more momentum and stability of your rear wheel.

They have also adjusted fluid levels for better resistance and improved the position of sealed?cartridge bearings for better inertia and an ultra-quiet ride that ensures increased wattage as you increase your speed.

And just like riding outside, simply shift gears to increase or decrease resistance. When you spin your wheels on the Fluid2 it feels like you're actually getting somewhere.

Stop logging junk miles and start employing our exclusive PowerTuned technology?the result of scientific and athletic collaboration. Now riding the trainer feels more like riding on the road because your wheel accelerates and decelerates on an infinite resistance curve, just like it does outside.

Professional cyclists and renowned scientist Allen Lim worked together to develop a power curve based on a hybrid of road and time trial positions, finding the point at which a speed of 25 mph overlaps with an output of 400 watts.

This point of overlap is where the optimal power curve resides and is the basis for PowerTuned technology. By training on a PowerTuned curve, you benefit from the most true-to-life speed verses power contingency, no matter what speed you ride at.

							No matter the terrain, whatever the sport, the RS800CX is the most accurate way to measure your speed and distance as well as plan, monitor and analyse your body's response to your training sessions. You can also see your route on a map after the training session. Ideal for cross-terrain sports like running, cycling, in-line skating, and kayaking, this is an essential addition to your training.

What sets this apart from the other RS800CX models is the G3 GPS sensor W.I.N.D. feature. The main benefits from this feature include:


Distance measured by Training, Trip, Lap and Total distances.
Incline measurement tells you the uphill or downhill inclination in numerical form, helping you to adjust cycling effort accordingly.
Your training computer stores your route data during training with GPS sensor and enables you to download route information to computer after the training session.
Speed (km/h or mi/h) is measured with GPS, footpod, stride sensor or cycling speed sensor.
