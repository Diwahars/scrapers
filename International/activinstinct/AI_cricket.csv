Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and
discreet, they avoid chafing.

Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.

Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.

Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.

Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance
between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.

Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.

Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.

OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection
certificate, declaring that it contains no chemical substances harmful to the skin.

							You don't stop breathing after the game.

The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time.

Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line.

Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again!

SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.

If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.

GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.

FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.

MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.

TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.

ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.

SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!

Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.

Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.MaterialNylon 76%Spandex 24%						",8499,9943.83,SKINS RY400 Ladies Compression Long Tights,SKINS,S;M;L,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/247141/16704419-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again! SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery. If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery. GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster. FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability. MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations. TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature. ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances. SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia! Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged. Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.MaterialNylon 76%Spandex 24%						",8499,9943.83,SKINS Mens RY400 Compression Long Tights,SKINS,S;M;L;XL,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2010/m09/188828/99768314-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activites.

The lenses themselves are made from Grilamid TR-90; a homopolyamide nylon characterized by an extremely high alternative bending strength, low density, and high resistance to chemical and UV damage.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

There is ventilation to increase the airflow and reduce fogging, and the adjustable temples top this pair off, allowing for a customizable fit and increased wearing comfort.

With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.

The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.
