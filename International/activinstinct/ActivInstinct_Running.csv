							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activites.

The lenses themselves are made from Grilamid TR-90; a homopolyamide nylon characterized by an extremely high alternative bending strength, low density, and high resistance to chemical and UV damage.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

There is ventilation to increase the airflow and reduce fogging, and the adjustable temples top this pair off, allowing for a customizable fit and increased wearing comfort.

With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.

The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.

							For recreational exercisers who want an easy start for fitness. This is a brilliant entry-level product; the screen is large and easy to read, while the functions are uncomplicated and incredibly user-friendly.

The FT2 comes with the T31 Coded Transmitter. This transmits your heart rate to your wrist unit. Slim and light, the ECG (electrocardiogram) accurate transmitter is fully water resistant and designed for all weather conditions.

It has a battery life of 2500 hours and prevents cross-talk from other electrical devices for an accurate measure of your training.


Key Features:


Polar OwnCode - Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only. Coding prevents interference from other training computers.
To help you train safely and effectively, the training computer determines your heart rate target zone limits automatically according to your age-based maximum heart rate (220 minus age). The limits are determined in beats per minute (bpm).
Heart Touch button-free operation of wrist unit.When HeartTouch is on, different training information during training can be accessed without pressing buttons, for instance, when gloves make pressing buttons difficult, by bringing your training computer close to your transmitter.
Manual Target Zone: This feature enables you to define the target zone as you want and is suitable for your training. You can set the target zone for your training as beats per minute (bpm).
You can define your target zones for a training session based on heart rate to help define the right intensity. When you are out of the preset zones, the training computer will give a visual and audible alarm.

Ideal for those who want to know if they're improving their fitness or burning fat. So if you want clear training guidance and an easy start to heart rate-based training, the FT7 is for you.

Main Features:

EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature which tells you during a training session if the main effect of your training is fat burning or fitness improvement. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.
Polar OwnCal calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training. This feature allows you to follow the kilocalories expended during one training session and cumulative kilocalories expended during several training sessions.
Polar OwnCode: Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only. Coding prevents interference from other training computers.
Training Load: This feature is available in Polar software. When you transfer training results from your training computer to polarpersonaltrainer.com, you can follow your training load and recovery in the training diary. Continuous monitoring of training load and recovery will help you recognize personal limits, avoid over- or undertraining, and adjust training intensity and duration according to your daily and weekly targets

							The Polar FT7 is a great way to assist in your training to improve fitness and burn fat.

Ideal for those who want to know if they're improving their fitness or burning fat. So if you want clear training guidance and an easy start to heart rate-based training, the FT7 is for you.

Main Features:

EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature which tells you during a training session if the main effect of your training is fat burning or fitness improvement. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.
Polar OwnCal calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training. This feature allows you to follow the kilocalories expended during one training session and cumulative kilocalories expended during several training sessions.
Polar OwnCode: Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only. Coding prevents interference from other training computers.
Training Load: This feature is available in Polar software. When you transfer training results from your training computer to polarpersonaltrainer.com, you can follow your training load and recovery in the training diary. Continuous monitoring of training load and recovery will help you recognize personal limits, avoid over- or undertraining, and adjust training intensity and duration according to your daily and weekly targets

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Long Sleeve Top with Zipper features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym. This top features a mock neck for added coverage in cold. GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster. FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged. Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn. The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 85%</li><li>Spandex 15%</li></ul>						</div>",7499,8773.83,SKINS A200 Men's Thermal Long Sleeve Top,"S,M",SKINS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/246625/22753186-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

<p>Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management.

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.

Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster. FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability. MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations. TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature. ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances. SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia! Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged. Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",7499,8773.83,SKINS Mens A400 Compression Long Tights,"S,M,L,XL",SKINS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2010/m09/188793/65121903-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							<p>You don't stop breathing after the game. The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time. Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line. Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again! SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery. If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles.

When the knee is flexed the Magic Power Band preserves energy consumption, thus allowing for greater explosive power when it's time to extend.

Either side of the knee cap is covered in Stable Contoured Structure, which provides greater joint stability. This is supported by a donut-shaped silicone, combined with high-density knitted fabric, which improves patella stability.

A combination of durable fitting knit and loosely fitting knit fabric mean that the brace is breathable and durable. The loosely fitting knit fabric is over the popliteal fossa which allows for extra comfort during motion.

The Knee Brace provides comfort as well as aiding in performance. Any added stress on the joint is helped by two Bilateral Spiral Stays which shift this stress, preventing any sprains or similar injuries from occurring.

							Compression garments enhance performance, delay fatigue, lower the risk of injury and speed up
recovery times. Based on fabrics and technology originally developed for medical compression products, they help to eliminate muscle and joint pain by supporting the muscles and reducing shock and vibrations.

The Compressport US calf guard is uniquely enhanced through the integration of a layer of 220 silicon gel buds surrounding the interior of the guard above the ankle. This optimises shock absorption, greatly reduces muscle oscillation and provides increased support to the Achilles tendon.

							The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts bring the benefits of their medical-grade compression to the
widest audience yet. Whatever your sport or physical activity, these shorts deliver optimum
compression to the thighs in total comfort.

The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts are designed to be worn underneath regular shorts or kit and are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate
targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and
reduces muscle vibration.

Targeted Compression: the seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.

Waistband: the Jacquard elastic waistband is designed for comfort and has silicone grip inside to keep the shorts in position.

Push-Up Zone: the shorts provide exceptional support to the groin area while offering maximum freedom of movement and comfort. The Push-Up Zone is woven from 100% pure natural fibres: cashmere is thermo-regulatory; copper has antifungal and antibacterial properties to prevent odours and irritation of the mucous membranes; soft wood pulp is highly absorbent and breathable.

Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and
discreet, they avoid chafing.

Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.

Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.

Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.

Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance
between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.

Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.

Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.

OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection
certificate, declaring that it contains no chemical substances harmful to the skin.

Quality Guarantee: Compressport guarantees your product for two years and will exchange it for any manufacturing fault or defect during that period.

These are engineered to move contact points forward and align your stride in a sleek and efficient construction. There is also BioMoGo DNA cushioning for customised comfort according to your weight, gait and pace.

The PureGrit is the trail option in the PureProject series, offering lightweight technologies off road. The outsole has a more aggressive, multi-directional lug pattern for greater grip; capable with dealing with a variety of surfaces. The concave shape delivers better balance by splaying out upon impact and creating more surface area for ground contact.

The new wrap tongue provides even greater comfort and the Ideal Heel has curvature in the heel to shift the contact point forward so that you land with more ground clearance under the middle of the heel, reducing internal stress. A split in the midsole forefoot (the Toe Flex) allows the big toe to function independently and engage your natural balance.

							The GEL-EXCEL33 has been revamped to offer protection, flexibility, comfort and support in a more natural, stripped-back shoe. Perfect for serious runners, it has been designed to work with your foot, enhancing natural motion at every point in the stride.

It now features Fluid Axis Technology, allowing for a more natural motion of the foot by letting the subtalar joint rotate around its axis. It also has a Clutch Counter exoskelatal heel to provide improved support and a better fitting heel.

The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.

At the core of the shoe is the revolutionary Propulsion Trusstic. It mimics the plantar fascia in the arch of your foot, harnessing your foot's energy to propel you forward.

The full-length Guidance Line also promotes a more efficient run, encouraging optimum foot positioning from foot-down to toe-off. A lower, more flexible midsole gives you a more natural road feel and running experience, while a 10mm heel drop puts you in the best biomechanical position for your foot. This lightweight approach doesn't compromise on support or durability.

The individual components of the shoe work together for an Impact Guidance System that gives you a more comfortable step and an improved gait. There is a memory foam sockliner in the shoe to provide additional cushioning and the spongy layer between the shoe and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot.

The GEL Cushioning System, Personal Heel Fit and durable AHAR+ sole ensure that your foot stays protected, without adding any unnecessary weight to the shoe. A lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides both impact support and additional fitting around the heel.MaterialRubber Synthetic 						",10899,12751.83,ASICS Gel-Excel33 3 Ladies Running Shoes,UK3;UK4;UK5;UK6.5;UK7;UK7.5;UK8;UK8.5;UK9,ASICS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m11/394189/19650600-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The Mizuno Wave Inspire 10 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly.

This version of the shoe is lighter, with more support, more comfort and more cushioning.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance.

Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

The ap+ compound increases cushioning and comfort levels that will last thanks to improved durability.VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry.

Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage. The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.

Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry. This is further bolstered by AIRmesh that allows the shoe to maintain a high standard of breathability providing a cool, dry feel.

							The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.

U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.

The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.

VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.

							The Mizuno Wave Creation 15 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. A new model with great cushioning and less weight, the Wave Creation 15 features a DynaMotion fit and AP+ midsole.

The inclusion of Mizuno's revolutionary Infinity Wave provides unmatched cushioning, rebound and durability by reducing the shoes reliance on traditional midsole foam. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground.

U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.

VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe.

Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage. The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.

Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry. This is further bolstered by AIRmesh that allows the shoe to maintain a high standard of breathability providing a cool, dry feel.

U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.

The Impact Guidance System (IGS) is an ASICS design philosophy. It aims to make shoe components from rear to midfoot and forefoot to work together effectively to allow the body to perform in a natural manner. ASICS designers strive to compliment, not correct, how the legs and feet move.

This works in hand with the shoe's Guidance Line; a vertical flex groove that decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.

The ComforDry Sockliner provides cushioning performance and anti-microbial properties for a cooler, drier and healthier environment.

Solyte is a proprietary cushioning material that provides an exceptionally lightweight midsole with excellent bounce-back and durability.

A top layer of injected Solyte provides a cushioned platform feel in the forefoot that result in gender specific cushioning.

With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.MaterialRubber Synthetic 						",9699,11347.83,ASICS Gel-Cumulus 15 Men's Running Shoe,UK6.5;UK7;UK7.5;UK8;UK8.5;UK9;UK9.5;UK10;UK10.5;UK11.5;UK12;UK13,ASICS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m11/394736/82179648-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The Mizuno Wave Inspire 10 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly.

This version of the shoe is lighter, with more support, more comfort and more cushioning.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance.

Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

The ap+ compound increases cushioning and comfort levels that will last thanks to improved durability.VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry.

							Ideal for running on the road, but equally at home on the trail, this shoe offers a more natural, lightweight option for running on a variety of environments.

Due to this need to perform on different terrain, the shoe has been fitted with a Terrafly sole. It will provide grip on hard surfaces, but also has enough depth in the lugs on the sole to provide suitable traction when the ground underfoot gets a little looser and softer.

The endurance rubber compound has been formulated for an optimal balance on wear and mixed terrain grip.

Inov8 has a range of Shoc Zone levels to give runners a choice of midsole cushioning denoted by an arrow system moulded into the midsoles. This is at level 2, better suited to short and middle distance runners, with the balance between underfoot sensitivity and shock absorption slightly favouring the former.MaterialRubber Synthetic Material 						",9600,11232,INOV8 Terrafly 303 Men's Trail Running Shoe,UK7;UK7.5;UK8;UK8.5;UK9;UK9.5;UK10;UK10.5;UK11;UK11.5;UK12,INOV8,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m08/376131/60795028-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

The CarbonSpan Plus shank is lighter, stronger, and tuned to your running. It provides a smooth powerful toe off in the way that plastic would fail to do so.

To add to all this, the Zoot Ultra Fit Upper is a compression-like upper used on all Zoot footwear, and this is no different. It gives the shoes an extremely comfortable fit that hugs your foot, meaning less clutter, a better fit, and more comfortable feet.

There is also asymmetrical lacing to work with the anatomy of the foot and wrap the arch securely in place.MaterialRubber Synthetic Material 						",9400,10998,ZOOT Ultra Kalani 3.0 Men's Running Shoe,UK7;UK7.5;UK8;UK8.5;UK9;UK9.5;UK10;UK10.5;UK11;UK12,ZOOT,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m03/346124/14059373-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The Hoka One Stinson Tarmac Running Shoe is designed to provide top performance on road surfaces where hardwearing abrasion resistance and impact absorption are critical. This shoe combines lightweight, rolling performance, an oversize EVA midsole, control and stability to make sure that all the bases are covered whether you're training or racing. This shoe is ideal for those extended distances and provides comfort hour after hour and mile after mile.

A unique rolling motion delivers superior underfoot performance with 50% rockering profile to provide a smooth, energy efficient stride transition from the heel strike to the push off. It is this progressive motion that propels you forward with each and every strike of the foot.

Oversized midsole with up to 2.5x the volume of EVA compared to standard running shoes provides outstanding impact absorption and a highly comfortable underfoot feel. This oversized approach ensures a natural stride whether on smooth road surfaces or the most uneven trails.

Control is provided by the unique patented bucket seat design which is recessed between 20mm to 30mm into the midsole to firmly support the heel and allowing precision striking and optimum foot stabilisation.

A 35% wider platform is designed to enhance underfoot stability and works to counteract the height of the shoe ensuring that you are comfortable and confident with every strike. Flexible, reinforced sidewalls, precision fit and close lacing systems to enhance the feeling of stability and support.

These shoes are so lightweight they help to alleviate fatigue over longer distances and are ideal for those who crave high-levels of performance without a weight penalty.

These are engineered to move contact points forward and align your stride in a sleek and efficient construction. There is also BioMoGo DNA cushioning for customised comfort according to your weight, gait and pace.

The PureGrit is the trail option in the PureProject series, offering lightweight technologies off road.

U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.

The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.

VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe.

							The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.

U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.

The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.

Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.

Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.

Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.

The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.

VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.

							<p>REFRESH Compression garments are designed for use after exercise. Extremely powerful and durable, these garments have been engineered to enhance blood circulation and lift the delivery of oxygen to the muscles. Featuring a rigid knit construction and graduated engineering, these are suited high performing athletes that need to recover fast.</p>

<p>The graduated pressure improved recovery by improving circulation and removing lactate from the muscles. This repairs muscles faster, reducing swelling and soreness.</p>

<p>Developed using extensive research and consultation with some of the best athletes in the world, 2XU have produced PWX; a collection of premium Compression fabrics engineered to offer brilliant levels of power, weight and flexibility: a devastating combination. Each PWX fabric features high grade elastomeric yarns, as well as a superior grade circular knit structure, and it is this that allows 360 degree stretch, unsurpassed power and unrivalled flexibility.</p>

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>SKINS speed up the turnaround of metabolic waste and improve the recirculation of blood lactate. SKINS are also proven to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",6899,8071.83,SKINS A400 Men's Sleeveless Top,"XS,M,L,XL",SKINS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/247218/47212444-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							<p>You don't stop breathing after the game.</p>

<p>The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time.</p>

<p>Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line. . .</p>

<p>Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again!</p>

<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

<p>Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance.

							<p>The Marathon Running Shorts are the lightest X-BIONIC running shorts, with a lower waistband, two crucial factors that Migidio Bourifa the multiple Italian marathon champion, who was closely involved in the development of these shorts felt would make these winners.</p>

<p>The seamless, exceptionally comfortable X-BIONIC Marathon Running Shorts are highly compressive to minimise muscle vibration and support your muscles and joints. Specially developed for long distance runners, they optimise movement while stimulating blood circulation. This means an improved supply of nutrients to the muscles and better athletic performance. At the same time, the sophisticated woven structure ensures an ideal fit. Climate control also a plays crucial part: the main feature is the corrugated intercooler structure on the front and back of the thighs. These three-dimensional woven elements soak up excess sweat and evaporate it near the skin for cooling. As well as this, the intercooler structure leaves a space between the garment and your skin for a film of sweat to provide additional cooling.</p>

<p>While you rest, the insulating effect of the intercooler takes over: trapped air insulates and protects your muscles from chill, thus lessening the risk of injury. On the less cold-sensitive inner thigh, the finely meshed AirConditioning Zone cools you during the active phase by means of direct air exchange and evaporation. The anatomically positioned 3D-BionicSphere system on the coccyx and abdomen areas provides extra temperature and moisture regulation. Sweat traps on the lower back catch excess moisture before you can feel it and soak it up to evaporate. This means that there is absolutely no risk of chafing when running long distances.</p>

<p>In summary, these are far less revealing, more supportive and provide far superior climate control than similar Lycra running pants.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>Two-Step front 3D-BionicSphere System: high-tech knitting technology ensures optimal support and climate comfort in the pants. The various ribs and surface elements are able to resolve the conflict between providing support and transporting moisture and warmth. The wad structure between the legs inhibits the accumulation of moisture and, as a consequence, friction sores.</p>

<p>Innerlap AirConditioningZone: The inner surface of the thighs are less sensitive to cold. Here, the Innerlap AirConditioningZone, a section of delicate weave with nil insulating properties, allows the thigh to cool down initially by means of ventilation. As soon as sweat begins to build up the efficiency of the cooling mechanism increases since this process is going on in direct proximity to the skin.</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere-System: at the coccyx ? perspiration from the lower back section is conducted away for evaporation via the 3D-BionicSphere-System on the coccyx. The SweatTraps in the lower back absorb perspiration flowing down to the buttocks.</p>

<p>ISO-Pad: Enables targeted insulation of individual body parts from a cold environment to protect the body from freezing in winter. This is how the optimised ISO-Pads retain more body heat, which is necessary to guarantee internal organ function and protect body parts which are vulnerable to cooling.</p>

<p>Self-adjusting cuff: the wide active drawstring fits to every leg size without slipping or constricting.</p>

<p>Intercooler: this 3D construction collects perspiration on the upper thigh and maintains it directly upon the skin so as to evaporate it to maximum effect directly on this important muscle group. In between periods of exertion, the intercooler?s rib technology lies in waves upon the muscle to provide insulation. The locked-in air protects these vulnerable muscles from over-cooling.</p>

							<p>The X-Bionic the Trick Ladies Running Shirt allows you to run longer and faster without overheating.</p>
<p>With The Trick, the innovative developers at X-BIONIC have found a new and superior way to regulate your temperature. Along an insulation zone on the spine, an overheating of the entire body is simulated tricking the brain into thinking you are warmer than you really are. To combat this, the brain initiates sweat production far earlier in your run. Even before the body overheats, it is cooled by sweat, effectively and more quickly. The strain on physical systems is relieved.</p>

<p>RESULT: You have more energy for performance. The Trick Running Shirt is also packed with other award-winning technology from X-BIONIC, such as the 3D-BionicSphere System on the chest and back, which will ensure that during your run, you remain at a constant 37 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area: Without giving the body the impression that it is getting cold, fresh air from the 3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area cools down the body temperature. The air is tempered inside the ducts, working like a sluice. Hot, moist air is disposed of using the dynamics of body warmth and then replaced with new fresh air.</p>

<p>AirComPlex-Zone: at the solar plexus, directly under the 12th thoracic vertebrae, important nerve fibres receive signals that influence one?s entire well-being. The AirComplex-Zone protects this sensitive area with special channels. Warm air enclosed there insulates optimally in the cold. The system?s structure processes excess sweat from physical activity and ensures appropriate cooling of the core.</p>

<p>SweatTraps: Trap perspiration before you start to feel it. Sweat is wicked away so it can evaporate using heat dynamics. A film of perspiration ? too thin to be noticeable ? is left behind to cool the skin.</p>

<p>THE TRICK: the latest technological development from X-BIONIC, described above.</p>
<p>Expansion Flex Zone at the shoulder joint: flexibility of the Expansion Flex Zone and the stretch of the yarn enable unrestricted movement, without the shirt riding up.</p>
<p>3D-BionicSphere System on the back: guarantees effective ventilation so moisture is quickly wicked and transported away. No sweat means insulating air pockets in the wavelike structure protect against cold.</p>

<p>37 degree CCR-Technology: An over-heated or under-cooled body is not able to perform. That?s why it works to keep itself constantly at the optimal body temperature of 37degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Fixation Ribs: On the abdomen keep the shirt in the right position. They guarantee that THE TRICK is positioned accurately on the back and can unleash its full effect.</p>

<p>Skin NODOR Nano-Technology: Skin NODOR?s pH neutral ions actively inhibit bacteria build-up and minimize odour-causing microorganisms.</p>

							<p>Highly acclaimed X-BIONIC running wear has frequently won 'best in test' awards and is recognised as being supremely technical, giving runners the competitive edge. With shorts,3 quarter and full length tights to choose from, the range has become a firm favourite with many athletes.</p>

<p>Now you can benefit from X-BIONICâs established technologies such as the 3D-BionicSphere System with their latest ground-breaking Effektor Technologie. Effektor unleashes the potential that until now seemed to be unrealistic â"" limits of muscle coordination, of body temperature regulation, heart rate, endurance, recovery time, lactate build-up and transmission of stimuli along nerve pathways.</p>

<p>The key â"" Partial Kompression, which reduces muscle oscillations, and improves the supply not only of oxygen but also of nutrients to your muscles, enabling quicker recovery. During sport activities body warmth is created: in extreme situations, up to 1,200 watts worth. Up to 90 % of this is released by the athlete from the skin to maintain a body temperate of 37 degrees C.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression applies targeted pressure on 1mm wide ridges. Left and right of the ridge is a compression-free area where compression could have a negative effect on blood circulation to the skin. In this way the blood flow through veins and capillaries remain unimpeded. Partial Kompression uses the skin as a surface for cooling and, thus, can take advantage of the bodyâs personal microclimate for optimising performance.</p>

<p>Wearing X-BIONIC products with Effektor Technologie, compared with standard compression clothing, could give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>50% less build-up of heat</li>
<li>Up to 10% greater endurance</li>
<li>Lower heart rate by 2.4 beats per minute</li>
<li>7% less lactate build up</li>
<li>20% faster recovery</li>
</ul><br>
<p>The X-BIONIC Ladies Effektor Running Power Tights also incorporate other new developments specific to women, such as Cohesion Wrap Technology.</p>

<p>Key Features:</p>

<p>Neural Response Effect: Partial Kompression puts peripheral nerve cells in a constant state of readiness, optimises the exchange of neural impulses between muscles and brain, increases muscle reactions, contractions and coordination, and decreases the risk of injury and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Cohesion Wrap Technology: With its Vicarious Connective Tissue, this new technology supports and stabilises areas of the female body with weak connective tissue. It provides, from the outside, what female connective tissue is lacking on the inside: stability. The compression and special zoned structure around the abdominal and buttock regions mean less lactate and metabolic waste can penetrate tissues. Key benefits of this technology, therefore, are support and stability, improved metabolism and breakdown of metabolic waste, support for lymphatic flow, reduced vibration and decreased build-up of cellulite.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression: A new benchmark in compression technology, Partial Kompression by X-BIONIC utilises the advantages of compression without neglecting cooling.</p>

<p>Self-Adjusting Cuff: The broad self-adjusting cuff at the waist and bottom of the shorts adapts to any leg size without slipping or constricting.</p>

In between periods of exertion, the intercoolerâs rib technology lies in waves upon the muscle to provide insulation. The locked-in air protects these vulnerable muscles from over-cooling.</p>

<p>ISO-Pad: Targeted insulation of individual body parts against ambient coldness can prevent the body from getting cold. This is why ISO-Pads over the hip bones retain body heat that is necessary to guarantee inner organ functionality.</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere-System at the Coccyx: The SweatTraps in the lower back catch sweat flowing towards to the buttocks. This phase, which often leads to friction sores and chafing, is thus interrupted before it can even begin.</p>

<p>Heat Transfer Zone: The extremely fine mesh between the compression ridges allows heat to be optimally dissipated during physical exertion.</p>

Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Long Sleeve Top features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>These race socks help reduce fatigue in the muscles of the lower leg, promoting recovery and increasing blood circulation. This helps fight off the chances of developing DVT.</p>

<p>These powerful and breathable compression garments feature the added benefit of graduated engineering for extra support and comfort. What this generates is a far more efficient delivery of oxygenated blood to fatigued muscles. These provide all the benefits that the PERFORM range does but with the added feature of graduated compression along the limbs, thus ensuring speedier muscle repair and recovery benefits following exercise.</p>

<p>Developed using extensive research and consultation with some of the best athletes in the world, 2XU have produced PWX; a collection of premium Compression fabrics engineered to offer brilliant levels of power, weight and flexibility: a devastating combination. Each PWX fabric features high grade elastomeric yarns, as well as a superior grade circular knit structure, and it is this that allows 360 degree stretch, unsurpassed power and unrivalled flexibility.</p>

<p>Deep Vein Thrombosis is a condition that mainly affects the lower body and is associated with long periods of travel or inactivity. 2XU Compression garments enhance blood flow in these areas through enhanced venous return, reducing the risk of DVT.</p>

							<p>The CHO PAT Knee Strap is designed to give relief from chondromalacia (irritated knee cap). The strap functions dynamically as the knee bends and straightens.</p>

<p>Pressure on the tendon below the knee cap helps guide the knee cap in the groove, and it is this that improves tracking and assists in spreading pressure uniformly over the surface area. In addition, the strap elevates the knee cap slightly which relieves harmful pressure.</p>

<p>Made to comfortable for all-day wear, this strap helps proper tracking of patella and relieves harmful pressure in the same area.</p>

<ul>
<li>CHONDROMALACIA is caused by improper tracking of the patella, causing excessive force or pressure to wear the under-surface of the patella. This leads to irritation of a portion of the knee cap, inflammation, degeneration and pain.</li>

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression.

							<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

							<p>This makes up part of the XFORM range that 2XU produce. It is designed to be used during and after exercise: Active and Recovery.</p>

<p>A variation from the standard version of XFORM Compression Tights. The Thermal Compression Tights utilise a brushed PWX FLEX fabric to give the wearer a far softer feel, one that is much warmer. As well as this, your core body temperature during use is regulated better, thus enhancing comfort and warmth when it gets cold.</p>

<p>These powerful and breathable compression garments feature the added benefit of graduated engineering for extra support and comfort. What this generates is a far more efficient delivery of oxygenated blood to fatigued muscles. These provide all the benefits that the PERFORM range does but with the added feature of graduated compression along the limbs, thus ensuring speedier muscle repair and recovery benefits following exercise.</p>

<p>Developed using extensive research and consultation with some of the best athletes in the world, 2XU have produced PWX; a collection of premium Compression fabrics engineered to offer brilliant levels of power, weight and flexibility: a devastating combination. Each PWX fabric features high grade elastomeric yarns, as well as a superior grade circular knit structure, and it is this that allows 360 degree stretch, unsurpassed power and unrivalled flexibility.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Shorts feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>This series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that this series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into these garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Short Sleeve Top features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>SKINS speed up the turnaround of metabolic waste and improve the recirculation of blood lactate. SKINS are also proven to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",6499,7603.83,SKINS A400 Men's Long Sleeve Top,"XS,S,M,L,XL,XXL,Black/Yellow,White",SKINS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/247267/52592096-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 85%</li><li>Spandex 15%</li></ul>						</div>",3999,4678.83,SKINS A200 Junior Thermal Tights,,SKINS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m09/246848/69688988-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

The DuoMax Support System consists of a dual density midsole positioned to enhance support and stability. There is extra cushioning and durability from the Solyte Midsole material; a lighter midsole compound than the standard EVA and SpeEVA midsoles that feature on other shoes.

Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury. Rearfoot GEL provides cushioning in all directions, absorbs impact forces and helps to stabilise the foot during heel contact. The GEL in the heel is left exposed in this case.

The Trusstic in the mid foot area provides stability whilst working in combination with the contoured midsole to help control torsion. AHAR+ on the outsole is placed in the heel to reduce wear and increase durability for those who do high mileage. Also the solid rubber outsole provides great longevity and durability.MaterialRubber Synthetic Material 						",7000,8190,ASICS Ladies Gel-Foundation 11 Running Shoes,,ASICS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m05/361741/20258991-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The Kinvara 4 is a perfect synthesis of celebrated design elements form previous versions. The redesigned upper continues to utilise FlexFilm for a lightweight, seamless feel. Those who love the Kinvara will appreciate the upgrade from ProGrid to PowerGrid in the heel landing zone for even smoother transitions and an improved overall ride.

A minimalist approach to shoe design has brought about this excellent running shoe; lightweight and responsive, it aids the foot in moving through the gait cycle as smoothly as possible while offering an incredible fit.

After studying patterns on thousands of test shoes, the Kinvara 4 now features XT-900 rubber strategically added to parts of the outsole for better durability; the outsole has also been bevelled to achieve even smoother transition. There is Flexfilm technology in the upper to secure the foot on the platform throughout the gait cycle and a 4mm heel-to-toe offset encourages a more balanced running form.

One reason for this impressive fit is the strategically placed memory foam in the heel which provides a heel pocket, thus contributing to the comfort. In addition to this, the shoe's Hydrator lining provides next-to-skin comfort while wicking away moisture.

The midsole consists of high abrasion EVA; lightweight with excellent cushioning and durability.

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

							The 15th version of the Gel-Nimbus showcases more of Asics pioneering technology. The classic, pioneering cushioning shoe offers the plushest ride.

This, the 4E version of the shoe, has an even wider upper and sole to allow the bones of the foot to spread, preventing discomfort around the toes.

Features and benefits:

The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement. With Guidance Line technology a vertical flex groove decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.

With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.

FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides ultimate bounce back and cushioning characteristics while being lightweight still. FliudFit technology then combines technical meh that stretches in multiple directions with stretch elements to create a glove-like fit.

The Ortholite sockliner provides the optimum cushioning performance that creates a cooler, drier and healthier shoe environment. The use of a discrete eyelet improves upper fit whilst reducing possible irritation stage whilst asymmetrical lacing creates an anatomically correct lacing environment that reduces potential for irritation and provides improved comfort and fit.

The Solyte midsole is a proprietary cushioning material that provides an exceptionally lightweight midsole with excellent bounce-back and durability.

							For active exercisers who are serious about training hard, the FT40 offers clear guidance to monitor fitness levels and help you to maximise your training.
The Polar FT40 is packed with features to enhance your training including an EnergyPointer that determines if the main effect of your training is fitness improvement or fat burning. The Polar Fitness test measures your aerobic fitness at rest and tells you your progress and also displays the calories you've burned.
Comes with comfortable textile transmitter and coded heart rate transmission to avoid cross-talk as well as visual and audible alarms when you're pushing too hard.

Delve deeper into the features:
Measure your heart rate and define target zones suited to your training. In Polar software or during strength training, heart rate can be displayed as a graphical trend, visually indicating the measurement of the work your heart does throughout exercise. Achieve the optimum intensity by setting targets based on your heart rate; when you're pushing too hard and are out of your preset zones, the training computer gives you a visual and audible alarm. You can set the target zone for your training as beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, or as a percentage of your heart rate reserve (HRR%).

EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature that allows you to achieve the optimum balance between improving fitness and burning fat. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.

Once you're race ready, you can also put yourself to the test by taking the Polar Fitness Test that measures your aerobic fitness at rest in just five minutes. The test is based on heart rate and heart rate variability at rest combined with personal information and the results can be broken down to give you total control.
Other essentials while exercising include Polar OwnCal, which calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training and Polar OwnCode, a coded transmission that picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only and prevents interference from other training computers.

The Polar FT40 keeps all of your training in memory helping you towards your long-term goals. A weekly history gathers your weekly training data while all of this information can be aggregated to keep you on track during the workout.
Once you hit your peak, the press of a button locks you to that zone and combines with the ZonePointer to monitor and alert you when you're falling short or exceeding it. HeartTouch is also incorporated for button free operation of wrist unit, leaving you to concentrate on reaching your goals.

							Unlike any other footwear around, bringing you closer to your environment and delivering a number of various positive health benefits by leveraging all of the natural biomechanics of your body.

These benefits include strengthening muscles in the feet and lower legs, improving the range of motion in the ankles generally allowing the body to move more naturally. The shoe also eliminates heel lift to evenly distribute body weight, and thus align the spine and improve posture, as well as stimulating neural function important to balance and agility.

The Seeya is the newest option for serious minimalism, bringing you closer to the barefoot sensation. The overall weight has been reduced and a breathable, mesh upper delivers high-end performance-driven footwear.

Minimum rubber thickness in the outsole maximises feel and flexibility, with a soft midsole that further reduces thickness and weight for natural movement. The stitched-in insole protects the skin during longer runs.

The lightweight, stretch mesh upper has a seamless collar and adjustable hook and loop closure.MaterialMesh Rubber 						",12299,14389.83,VIBRAM Fivefingers Seeya Men's Running Shoe,,VIBRAM,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2013/m06/366357/99029021-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The GEL-EXCEL33 has been revamped to offer protection, flexibility, comfort and support in a more natural, stripped-back shoe. Perfect for serious runners, it has been designed to work with your foot, enhancing natural motion at every point in the stride.

It now features Fluid Axis Technology, allowing for a more natural motion of the foot by letting the subtalar joint rotate around its axis. It also has a Clutch Counter exoskelatal heel to provide improved support and a better fitting heel.

The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.

At the core of the shoe is the revolutionary Propulsion Trusstic. It mimics the plantar fascia in the arch of your foot, harnessing your foot's energy to propel you forward.

The full-length Guidance Line also promotes a more efficient run, encouraging optimum foot positioning from foot-down to toe-off. A lower, more flexible midsole gives you a more natural road feel and running experience, while a 10mm heel drop puts you in the best biomechanical position for your foot. This lightweight approach doesn't compromise on support or durability.

The individual components of the shoe work together for an Impact Guidance System that gives you a more comfortable step and an improved gait. There is a memory foam sockliner in the shoe to provide additional cushioning and the spongy layer between the shoe and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot.

The GEL Cushioning System, Personal Heel Fit and durable AHAR+ sole ensure that your foot stays protected, without adding any unnecessary weight to the shoe. A lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides both impact support and additional fitting around the heel.MaterialRubber Synthetic Material 						",12749,14916.33,ASICS Gel-Excel33 3 Men's Running Shoes,,ASICS,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2014/m05/430355/77864683-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The RCX5 is for triathletes, runners, cyclists and endurance athletes who want to optimize their training.

This Run version of the monitor is different to the Bike version and standard version in that it includes the s3+ stride sensor. Some of the features of this include the following:


Measures average stride length. Runners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length increases as speed increases. Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride length is the natural one; the one that feels most comfortable.
Running cadence measures how many times either your right or left foot hits the ground in one minute. Running cadence is measured as steps per minute. With this feature you can sharpen your cadence and make your ground contact time shorter. This will help you to find a balance between leg power and leg speed.
Race Pace allows you to set a target speed/pace for a certain distance. It then helps pacing the run or ride by showing the current speed/pace and by telling in time, how much you are behind or ahead of the set target.
Running Index is based on heart rate and speed data measured during the run. It gives daily information about your performance level, both aerobic fitness and running economy. Improvement in running efficiency indicates improved economy of running performance.

As well as these features, there are also some more generic features common with all RCX5 models.

							With a touch, tap or swipe, Forerunner 610 lets you get on with your run while it tracks all the details.

Forerunner 610 gives you several ways to get in touch with your training data. The swipe and scroll action makes it easy to adjust settings, review your run history and more. A quick tap of the screen is all it takes to advance to the next training page so you can see more data.

The 610's sleek touchscreen is as rugged as it is functional. The 610 can stand up to rain, sweat and splashes, yet it's sensitive enough that you can operate it with running gloves.

The 610 provides accurate distance, pace, GPS position, heart rate, calories and more. It can even guide you back to the starting point of your run, giving you the freedom to explore new routes and always find your way back.

Training tools like the new Virtual Racer can turn any workout into a virtual matchup. This feature lets you race your previous bests or challenge any activities that you may have uploaded. You can also use the Virtual Partner function to see how you measure up to a static pace you set. Forerunner 610 also offers vibration alerts, which you can customize for time, distance, calories, heart rate or cadence. So, when you reach your targets, you'll feel a gentle vibration.

This is the first sport watch from Garmin with the Training Effect capability from Firstbeat. Training Effect measures the impact of an activity on your aerobic fitness, which essentially helps you train more efficiently. Your Training Effect is calculated based on your user profile, your heart rate and the difficulty of the activity. The 610 also offers customizable heart rate zones, alerts and heart-rate based calorie computations.

When your workout's done, Forerunner 610 keeps working. It wirelessly uploads your run data when in range of your computer so you can go back and review your run on your own time. It works via ANT+ wireless technology and the USB stick that comes with your watch. No wires, no manual uploads, no sweat. You can then see your activity on a map, view lap splits and explore activities from other users.

You also can track weight, body fat, body water and six other measurements when using the Forerunner 610 with the Tanita BC-1000 body composition scale. The readings are stored on Forerunner 610, then automatically sent to Garmin Connect when in range of your computer.
