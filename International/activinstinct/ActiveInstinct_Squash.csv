							UltraNick offers a fine, powerful, lightweight and durable string, just like PowerNick, but with the addition of a soft feel.

This is possible due to recent advances that have produced finer Zyex filaments in the string core, with new multifilament core packages with increased linear density and more cross-sectional strength being used.

The results are thinner, stronger, light-weight UltraNick strings which provide softer feel, more power, and improved ball control, yet still offer the well-known Zyex playing characteristics and tension holding properties.

							Ashaway has improved its SuperNick XL Micro Squash string to provide increased durability, improved shot making, and stronger brand recognition.

The original SuperNick XL Micro was a white, 18 gauge string, well regarded among top amateur players for its resiliency and ball control. In the new SuperNick XL Micro, Ashaway has modified the string's unique construction of nylon multifilament core and double-braided multifilament jacket. The increased linear density of the finished string results in superior durability for an 18 gauge string, while still providing gut-like performance and excellent playability at lower tensions.

Also new to SuperNick XL Micro is a textured surface like the other standard 17 gauge SuperNick XL products. This textured surface allows for optimum shotmaking and excellent ball control.

SuperNick XL Micro squash string is recommended for all styles and levels of play, and for players looking for improved feel and control of the ball.

Air Mesh, synthetic leather and Personal Heel Fit in the upper provide excellent comfort and breathability.

Biomorphic Fit technology allows the upper of the shoe to move in harmony with the foot, giving more comfort while in motion. This fit means the shoe material does not bunch, reducing the risk of blisters or irritation.

The Impact Guidance System (IGS) is an ASICS design philosophy. It aims to make shoe components from rear to midfoot and forefoot to work together effectively to allow the body to perform in a natural manner. ASICS designers strive to compliment, not correct, how the legs and feet move.

Utilises the Space Trusstic, an advanced system that creates a pocket between the Trusstic System device and the midsole, allowing for greater midsole deformation and more efficient foot function.

Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury.

Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury.

The Compression Molded EVA Sockliner can be removed to accommodate a medical orthotic, while the Trusstic System reduces the weight of the sole unit while retaining the structural integrity of the shoe.

							Indoor court shoes require tremendous amounts of grip. They have to be able to deal with sharp changes of direction, explosive bursts of movement, and supply support and comfort throughout. These are a fantastic example of this required performance.

Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury.

The Compression Molded EVA Sockliner can be removed to accommodate a medical orthotic, while the Trusstic System reduces the weight of the sole unit while retaining the structural integrity of the shoe.

This shoe also uses California Slip Lasting to enhance its stability and comfort. This is achieved through the upper being stitched around a canvas or EVA board and directly attached to the midsole.
