							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activites.

The lenses themselves are made from Grilamid TR-90; a homopolyamide nylon characterized by an extremely high alternative bending strength, low density, and high resistance to chemical and UV damage.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

There is ventilation to increase the airflow and reduce fogging, and the adjustable temples top this pair off, allowing for a customizable fit and increased wearing comfort.

With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.

The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.

							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activities.

The Tifosi Podium Interchangeable Sunglasses feature a proprietary interchangeable frameless lens design that provides an unobstructed field of vision. In addition these glasses benefit from polycarbonate decentred lenses.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

This new Clarion Collection features a new lens coating technology, combined with strong colours for brilliant style. Clarion lenses use a full mirror hydrophobic coating, preventing both water and sweat from beading up on the lens surface to improve visibility in all conditions.

Clarion technology greatly reduces glare and provides an even colour treatment across the entire width of the lens, ensuring consistent light transmission, thus reducing eye fatigue.

							Celebrating the 30th anniversary of Oakley performance eyewear, the Heritage Collection salutes the evolution of a revolution by bringing back vintage rarities for a limited time.

Designed specifically for demanding sporting activity, this revolutionary eyewear lets athletes change lenses depending on their environment, thanks to Switchlock Technology. Switchlock lets you adapt your vision and changes lenses quickly and hassle-free. The simple switch mechanism makes the process quick and easy, and the lens is held securely in place without uneven pressures that can bend it and distort your vision.

Interchangeable nose pads let you achieve a comfortable, customizable fit, and the earsocks are made of the same sport-optimized Unobtainium to increase grip when you sweat. Uneven pressure points are eliminated because its Three-Point Fit holds the frame comfortably in place while keeping the lens in precise optical alignment, rather than hooking over your ears.

Radarlock comes in an Oakley Soft Vault case that lets you store an extra lens, and each frame comes with two lenses: one for bright days and one for low-light conditions.

Now you can enjoy the same benefits at your training sessions, or even in your own back garden, on the beach or in the park. It can be fun for the whole family, learning the basics of catching and throwing, while improving coordination and enjoying it along the way.

The 'sane' side gives a consistent rebound while the 'insane' side generates random rebounds; the ball returns erratically, testing and improving your reactions and hand-eye co-ordination in a manner similar to slip practice, and is ideal to replace the old fashioned slip cradle.

This particular model, although adaptable, is more suited to schools, sports clubs and teams, as well as professional athletes.
