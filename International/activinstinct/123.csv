							<p>The Marathon Running Shorts are the lightest X-BIONIC running shorts, with a lower waistband, two crucial factors that Migidio Bourifa the multiple Italian marathon champion, who was closely involved in the development of these shorts felt would make these winners.</p>

<p>The seamless, exceptionally comfortable X-BIONIC Marathon Running Shorts are highly compressive to minimise muscle vibration and support your muscles and joints. Specially developed for long distance runners, they optimise movement while stimulating blood circulation. This means an improved supply of nutrients to the muscles and better athletic performance. At the same time, the sophisticated woven structure ensures an ideal fit. Climate control also a plays crucial part: the main feature is the corrugated intercooler structure on the front and back of the thighs. These three-dimensional woven elements soak up excess sweat and evaporate it near the skin for cooling. As well as this, the intercooler structure leaves a space between the garment and your skin for a film of sweat to provide additional cooling.</p>

<p>While you rest, the insulating effect of the intercooler takes over: trapped air insulates and protects your muscles from chill, thus lessening the risk of injury. On the less cold-sensitive inner thigh, the finely meshed AirConditioning Zone cools you during the active phase by means of direct air exchange and evaporation. The anatomically positioned 3D-BionicSphere system on the coccyx and abdomen areas provides extra temperature and moisture regulation. Sweat traps on the lower back catch excess moisture before you can feel it and soak it up to evaporate. This means that there is absolutely no risk of chafing when running long distances.</p>

<p>In summary, these are far less revealing, more supportive and provide far superior climate control than similar Lycra running pants.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>Two-Step front 3D-BionicSphere System: high-tech knitting technology ensures optimal support and climate comfort in the pants. The various ribs and surface elements are able to resolve the conflict between providing support and transporting moisture and warmth. The wad structure between the legs inhibits the accumulation of moisture and, as a consequence, friction sores.</p>

<p>Innerlap AirConditioningZone: The inner surface of the thighs are less sensitive to cold. Here, the Innerlap AirConditioningZone, a section of delicate weave with nil insulating properties, allows the thigh to cool down initially by means of ventilation. As soon as sweat begins to build up the efficiency of the cooling mechanism increases since this process is going on in direct proximity to the skin.</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere-System: at the coccyx ? perspiration from the lower back section is conducted away for evaporation via the 3D-BionicSphere-System on the coccyx. The SweatTraps in the lower back absorb perspiration flowing down to the buttocks.</p>

<p>ISO-Pad: Enables targeted insulation of individual body parts from a cold environment to protect the body from freezing in winter. This is how the optimised ISO-Pads retain more body heat, which is necessary to guarantee internal organ function and protect body parts which are vulnerable to cooling.</p>

<p>Self-adjusting cuff: the wide active drawstring fits to every leg size without slipping or constricting.</p>

<p>Intercooler: this 3D construction collects perspiration on the upper thigh and maintains it directly upon the skin so as to evaporate it to maximum effect directly on this important muscle group. In between periods of exertion, the intercooler?s rib technology lies in waves upon the muscle to provide insulation. The locked-in air protects these vulnerable muscles from over-cooling.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression: A new benchmark in compression technology. Partial Kompression by</p>

<p>X-BIONIC utilises the advantages of compression without neglecting cooling.</p>

<p>SkinNODOR with Nano-Technology: A climate-active nano-filament which contains an inorganic bacteriostatic agent. The ions inside the fibre inhibit the reproduction of micro-organisms.</p>

							<p>The X-Bionic the Trick Ladies Running Shirt allows you to run longer and faster without overheating.</p>
<p>With The Trick, the innovative developers at X-BIONIC have found a new and superior way to regulate your temperature. Along an insulation zone on the spine, an overheating of the entire body is simulated tricking the brain into thinking you are warmer than you really are. To combat this, the brain initiates sweat production far earlier in your run. Even before the body overheats, it is cooled by sweat, effectively and more quickly. The strain on physical systems is relieved.</p>

<p>RESULT: You have more energy for performance. The Trick Running Shirt is also packed with other award-winning technology from X-BIONIC, such as the 3D-BionicSphere System on the chest and back, which will ensure that during your run, you remain at a constant 37 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area: Without giving the body the impression that it is getting cold, fresh air from the 3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area cools down the body temperature. The air is tempered inside the ducts, working like a sluice. Hot, moist air is disposed of using the dynamics of body warmth and then replaced with new fresh air.</p>

<p>AirComPlex-Zone: at the solar plexus, directly under the 12th thoracic vertebrae, important nerve fibres receive signals that influence one?s entire well-being. The AirComplex-Zone protects this sensitive area with special channels. Warm air enclosed there insulates optimally in the cold. The system?s structure processes excess sweat from physical activity and ensures appropriate cooling of the core.</p>

<p>SweatTraps: Trap perspiration before you start to feel it. Sweat is wicked away so it can evaporate using heat dynamics. A film of perspiration ? too thin to be noticeable ? is left behind to cool the skin.</p>

<p>THE TRICK: the latest technological development from X-BIONIC, described above.</p>
<p>Expansion Flex Zone at the shoulder joint: flexibility of the Expansion Flex Zone and the stretch of the yarn enable unrestricted movement, without the shirt riding up.</p>
<p>3D-BionicSphere System on the back: guarantees effective ventilation so moisture is quickly wicked and transported away. No sweat means insulating air pockets in the wavelike structure protect against cold.</p>

<p>37 degree CCR-Technology: An over-heated or under-cooled body is not able to perform. That?s why it works to keep itself constantly at the optimal body temperature of 37degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Fixation Ribs: On the abdomen keep the shirt in the right position. They guarantee that THE TRICK is positioned accurately on the back and can unleash its full effect.</p>

<p>Skin NODOR Nano-Technology: Skin NODOR?s pH neutral ions actively inhibit bacteria build-up and minimize odour-causing microorganisms.</p>

							<p>Wearing the new Effektor Running Power Shirt has been described as like wearing a second skin. It is packed with X-BIONIC?s award-winning and patented technologies, such as the 3D-BionicSphere-System, which keeps you warm when you are cold, and cool when you are warm. But that is not all. For the lime green Power Shirt heralds the dawn of a new era in compression clothing, with the launch of Effektor Technologie.</p>

<p>Effektor unleashes the potential that until now seemed to be unrealistic ? limits of muscle coordination, of body temperature regulation, heart rate, endurance, recovery time, lactate build-up and transmission of stimuli along nerve pathways. The key ? Partial Kompression, which reduces muscle oscillations, and improves the supply not only of oxygen but also of nutrients to your muscles, enabling quicker recovery.</p>

<p>During sport activities body warmth is created: in extreme situations, up to 1,200 watts worth. Up to 90 % of this is released by the athlete from the skin to maintain a body temperate of 37 degrees C. X-BIONIC Partial Kompression applies targeted pressure on 1mm wide ridges. Left and right of the ridge is a compression-free area where compression could have a negative effect on blood circulation to the skin. In this way the blood flow through veins and capillaries remain unimpeded. Partial Kompression uses the skin as a surface for cooling and, thus, can take advantage of the body?s personal microclimate for optimising performance.</p>

<p>Wearing X-BIONIC products with Effektor Technologie compared with standard compression clothing, could give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>50% less build-up of heat</li>
<li>Up to 10% greater endurance</li>
<li>Lower heart rate by 2.4 beats per minute</li>
<li>7% less lactate build up</li>
<li>20% faster recovery</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Features:</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area: Without giving the body the impression that it is getting cold, fresh air from the 3D-BionicSphere System in the chest area cools down the body temperature. The air is tempered inside the ducts, working like a sluice. Hot, moist air is disposed of using the dynamics of body warmth and then replaced with new fresh air.</p>

<p>ISO-Pad: Targeted insulation of individual body parts against ambient coldness can prevent the body from getting cold. This is why ISO-Pads over the hipbones retain body heat that is necessary to guarantee inner organ functionality.</p>

<p>AirComplex-Zone: In the solar plexus important nerves receive signals that influence one?s entire well-being. This sensitive area is protected with special channels. Locked-in warm air insulates optimally in the cold, whilst the system?s structure processes excess sweat from physical activity and ensures appropriate coolness in the core.</p>
<p>SweatTraps: Designed for large underarm areas to prevent dripping and to cool more effectively.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression: A new benchmark in compression technology, Partial Kompression by X-BIONIC utilises the advantages of compression without neglecting cooling.</p>

<p>Neural Response Effect: Partial Kompression puts peripheral nerve cells in a constant state of readiness, optimises the exchange of neural impulses between muscles and brain, increases muscle reactions, contractions and coordination, and decreases the risk of injury and exhaustion.</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere System on the back: Varying amounts of heat are produced in different regions of the body, with that form the chest and back being particularly high due to the need to protect vital internal organs. The 3D-BionicSphere System leaves a thin film of moisture on the skin with the sensation of dampness. SweatTraps then transport excess sweat, allow it to evaporate, and then dispose of it via thermal dynamics. Remaining is only a comfortable, thin, cooling layer of moisture. In colder temperatures, during rest and recovery phases, the system switches to insulation mode.</p>

<p>ISO-Shoulder: The ribbed structure across this area protects the shoulders from chilling wind and energy-sapping cold.</p>

<p>Heat Transfer Zone: The extremely fine mesh between the compression ridges allows heat to be optimally dissipated during physical exertion.</p>

							<p>Highly acclaimed X-BIONIC running wear has frequently won 'best in test' awards and is recognised as being supremely technical, giving runners the competitive edge. With shorts,3 quarter and full length tights to choose from, the range has become a firm favourite with many athletes.</p>

<p>Now you can benefit from X-BIONICâs established technologies such as the 3D-BionicSphere System with their latest ground-breaking Effektor Technologie. Effektor unleashes the potential that until now seemed to be unrealistic â"" limits of muscle coordination, of body temperature regulation, heart rate, endurance, recovery time, lactate build-up and transmission of stimuli along nerve pathways.</p>

<p>The key â"" Partial Kompression, which reduces muscle oscillations, and improves the supply not only of oxygen but also of nutrients to your muscles, enabling quicker recovery. During sport activities body warmth is created: in extreme situations, up to 1,200 watts worth. Up to 90 % of this is released by the athlete from the skin to maintain a body temperate of 37 degrees C.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression applies targeted pressure on 1mm wide ridges. Left and right of the ridge is a compression-free area where compression could have a negative effect on blood circulation to the skin. In this way the blood flow through veins and capillaries remain unimpeded.

<li>Lower heart rate by 2.4 beats per minute</li>
<li>7% less lactate build up</li>
<li>20% faster recovery</li>
</ul><br>
<p>The X-BIONIC Ladies Effektor Running Power Tights also incorporate other new developments specific to women, such as Cohesion Wrap Technology.</p>

<p>Key Features:</p>

<p>Neural Response Effect: Partial Kompression puts peripheral nerve cells in a constant state of readiness, optimises the exchange of neural impulses between muscles and brain, increases muscle reactions, contractions and coordination, and decreases the risk of injury and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Cohesion Wrap Technology: With its Vicarious Connective Tissue, this new technology supports and stabilises areas of the female body with weak connective tissue. It provides, from the outside, what female connective tissue is lacking on the inside: stability. The compression and special zoned structure around the abdominal and buttock regions mean less lactate and metabolic waste can penetrate tissues. Key benefits of this technology, therefore, are support and stability, improved metabolism and breakdown of metabolic waste, support for lymphatic flow, reduced vibration and decreased build-up of cellulite.</p>

<p>X-BIONIC Partial Kompression: A new benchmark in compression technology, Partial Kompression by X-BIONIC utilises the advantages of compression without neglecting cooling.</p>

<p>Self-Adjusting Cuff: The broad self-adjusting cuff at the waist and bottom of the shorts adapts to any leg size without slipping or constricting.</p>

<p>Intercooler: The 3D construction collects perspiration on the upper thigh and maintains it directly upon the skin so as to evaporate it to maximum effect directly on this important muscle group. In between periods of exertion, the intercoolerâs rib technology lies in waves upon the muscle to provide insulation. The locked-in air protects these vulnerable muscles from over-cooling.</p>

<p>ISO-Pad: Targeted insulation of individual body parts against ambient coldness can prevent the body from getting cold. This is why ISO-Pads over the hip bones retain body heat that is necessary to guarantee inner organ functionality.</p>

<p>3D-BionicSphere-System at the Coccyx: The SweatTraps in the lower back catch sweat flowing towards to the buttocks. This phase, which often leads to friction sores and chafing, is thus interrupted before it can even begin.</p>

<p>Heat Transfer Zone: The extremely fine mesh between the compression ridges allows heat to be optimally dissipated during physical exertion.</p>

<p>SkinNODOR with Nano-Technology: a climate-active nano-filament which contains an inorganic bacteriostatic agent. The ions inside the fibre inhibit the reproduction of micro-organisms.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>The Skins A200 Series collection for women was designed by women for women so the garments feature flattering lines to give you a sleek silhouette as well as this season?s hottest colours.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 85%</li><li>Spandex 15%</li></ul>						</div>",£67.99," ,

							<p>The Nike Victory Contour Sports Bra features a compression fit for lift and support in a lightweight, streamlined design, helping keep you comfortable during medium-impact workouts.</p>

<p>Benefits</p>

<li>Ideal for medium-impact sports like cycling, dance and cardio classes</li>
<li>Best for A, B and C cups</li>
<li>Under-bust seams for shape and support</li>
<li>Mesh panels to increase ventilation</li>
<li>Two-layer compression fit for comfortable support</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Design</p>
<p>The Nike Victory Contour Sports Bra has two layers of sturdy compression fabric that lifts and supports, while stabilizers in the straps reduce stretch for extra support and less bounce. Soft elastic binding around the neckline and arm holes, along with flat, bonded seams at the shoulders, help reduce irritation due to chafing. For enhanced range of motion during upper-body workouts, this bra has a racerback plus a low-profile, elastic chest band for lightweight comfort.</p>

<p>Fabric</p>
<p>Dri-FIT jersey fabric helps you stay dry and comfortable by wicking sweat away from skin to the fabric's surface, where it quickly evaporates. Dri-FIT mesh at the upper-back and centre-front lining delivers excellent ventilation in these high-heat areas. Stretchy elastane in the fabric allows for freedom of movement and an athletic fit.</p>

<p>Origins</p>
<p>The Nike Pro Victory bras: a team of six absolutely perfect styles made for every size, workout and support level. How did Nike do it. By obsessing over every detail. A team of designers consulted 1,424 women and then developed 120 versions of the chest band, perfecting every element down to the thread and thread count. The result - Each new bra is 10 to 27 percent lighter and 35 to 60 percent stronger than its predecessors. Unique design details set each style apart to create the right support for your sport.</p>

							<p>These revolutionary Speed Metal socks employ a newly developed yarn: XITANIT. This has the ability to reflect external heat make these socks feel tangibly cooler to the skin. The result is perceptible, and anyone can at once feel the cooling effect. When exposed to the UV rays, the sock is cold inside, warm outside. Furthermore, the high conductibility means that warmth generated by the feet is led away from them.</p>

<p>Another decisive factor is that XITANIT quickly and lastingly draws moisture away from the foot. This effect is supported by the AirCool Stripes, the AirFlow AnklePads and the AirConditioning Channels, which ventilate the feet.

							<p>The adidas adiZero Short Sleeve Tee is part of the new range of adizero running apparel from adidas. Designed for speed and comfort, the adizero range of apparel is manufactured from super lightweight ClimaCool fabric with a tighter, more aggressive ForMotion cut for unsurpassed fit while in motion. Strategically located ventilation in critical sweat zones allows you to stay dry and comfortable for longer.</p>

<p>According to adidas, an athlete can actually stay cooler in ClimaCool apparel than they can in bare skin. This is because ClimaCool fabric actively draws heat and sweat away from the body using heat and moisture-dissipating materials. This is then enhanced with ventilation channels, as well as three-dimensional fabrics, all working together to allow air to circulate close to the skin. By mapping the body's critical heat and sweat zones using infrared cameras, designers are able to place these technologies exactly where they are needed.</p>

							<p>The Asics Gel Kayano is the legend of the running shoe with each year bringing a new evolution and the 20th version once again delivers an outstanding ride for the moderate over-pronator. As an IGS development the transition through the 3 phases of gait is very smooth and efficient with an enhanced upper fit and improved forefoot comfort.</p>

<p>Features and Benefits:</p>

<p>The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.</p>

<p>The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement. With Guidance Line technology a vertical flex groove decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.</p>

<p>With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.</p>

<p>The ComforDry sockliner provides the optimum cushioning performance that creates a cooler, drier and healthier shoe environment. The use of a discrete eyelet improves upper fit whilst reducing possible irritation stage whilst asymmetrical lacing creates an anatomically correct lacing environment that reduces potential for irritation and provides improved comfort and fit.</p>

<p>The Solyte midsole is a proprietary cushioning material that provides an exceptionally lightweight midsole with excellent bounce-back and durability. DuoMax is an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation.</p>

<p>The lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides improved support and fitting around the heel, while Biomorphic fit in the upper utilises stretchy material to reduce bunching, which can lead to blisters and irritation, when the shoe moves.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£125.99," ,

							<p>The Hoka One Stinson Tarmac Running Shoe is designed to provide top performance on road surfaces where hardwearing abrasion resistance and impact absorption are critical. This shoe combines lightweight, rolling performance, an oversize EVA midsole, control and stability to make sure that all the bases are covered whether you're training or racing. This shoe is ideal for those extended distances and provides comfort hour after hour and mile after mile.</p>

<p>A unique rolling motion delivers superior underfoot performance with 50% rockering profile to provide a smooth, energy efficient stride transition from the heel strike to the push off. It is this progressive motion that propels you forward with each and every strike of the foot.</p>

<p>Oversized midsole with up to 2.5x the volume of EVA compared to standard running shoes provides outstanding impact absorption and a highly comfortable underfoot feel. This oversized approach ensures a natural stride whether on smooth road surfaces or the most uneven trails.</p>

<p>Control is provided by the unique patented bucket seat design which is recessed between 20mm to 30mm into the midsole to firmly support the heel and allowing precision striking and optimum foot stabilisation.</p>

<p>A 35% wider platform is designed to enhance underfoot stability and works to counteract the height of the shoe ensuring that you are comfortable and confident with every strike. Flexible, reinforced sidewalls, precision fit and close lacing systems to enhance the feeling of stability and support.</p>

<p>These shoes are so lightweight they help to alleviate fatigue over longer distances and are ideal for those who crave high-levels of performance without a weight penalty.</p>

The ultimate Wave features two parallel plates that sit together with soft cushioning pillars in between to provide unrivalled cushioning and improved durability by absorbing and dispersing the impact at foot strike.</p>

Smooth Ride engineering minimises the rapid rates of acceleration and deceleration of the foot during transition, creating as smooth a ride as possible.</p>

							<p>The MBT Sport 4 Shoe is designed for those who lead an active lifestyle and require maximum comfort no matter how many hours they spend on their feet.</p>

<p>Constructed from 3D mesh which is a light-weight, 3D woven fabric and is highly breathable. Features Synthetic PU-coated materials and synthetic materials that are highly durable and resistant so you get the utmost in both comfort and quality.</p>

<p>Sport SS12 outsole ensures you're comfortable at all times whilst it boasts extra high levels of durability.</p>

<p>Features a Dual Board shank that consists of TPU (heel &amp; midfoot area) and nylon mixed with glass fibres (forefoot area). Its dual density provides high wearing comfort.</p>

<p>This construction uses new technology allowing the shank and lasting board to form one single piece, which is attached directly to the bottom unit.</p>

<p>MBT's have been designed to stimulate the postural and stabilising musculature of the whole body. Revolutionary sole construction utilising the interplay of the Shank, PU midsole and Masai Sensor places the body in a natural instability that can otherwise only be achieved by walking barefoot on natural, uneven surfaces. The natural instability activates the body's supporting muscle system and has positive effects on the entire body.</p>

<p>The positive effects of wearing MBTs includes significantly improving your gait and posture whilst relieving stress in your joints and back. Additionally they exercise a large number of muscles, whether you're walking or standing. This in turn, stimulates your metabolism, burns extra calories and supports muscle regeneration.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£170.99," ,

<p>Secure Fit</p>
<p>Made with lightweight, breathable mesh, the full-length inner sleeve provides a sock-like fit that hugs the foot, but still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>Advanced flex grooves deliver exceptional range of motion.</p>

<p>The DiamondFLX design on the outsole enhances flexibility for multi-directional movement while providing a lightweight, low-profile fit.</p>

<p>Lightweight Lockdown</p>
<p>Criss-crossed bands integrated with the laces wrap the midfoot to create an adaptive, secure fit.</p>

<p>While the foot is at rest or moving forward or backward the bands are flexible and compliant. When pressure is applied during side-to-side movements the bands engage and tighten around the foot for added support.</p>

<p>Stability and Support</p>
<p>The midsole wraps up the foot at the heel and the midfoot to help keep it stable during side-to-side and diagonal movements. And seam-free overlays at the heel and forefoot minimise chafing while adding support.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li></ul>						</div>",£69.00," ,

							<p>The Nike Free Trainer 5.0 Men's Training Shoe delivers lightweight flexibility, supportive lockdown and total comfort for workouts in the gym, on the field and beyond.</p>

<p>Secure Fit</p>
<p>Made with lightweight, breathable mesh, the full-length inner sleeve provides a sock-like fit that hugs the foot, but still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>Advanced flex grooves deliver exceptional range of motion.</p>

<p>The DiamondFLX design on the outsole enhances flexibility for multi-directional movement while providing a lightweight, low-profile fit.</p>

<p>Lightweight Lockdown</p>
<p>Criss-crossed bands integrated with the laces wrap the midfoot to create an adaptive, secure fit.</p>

<p>While the foot is at rest or moving forward or backward the bands are flexible and compliant. When pressure is applied during side-to-side movements the bands engage and tighten around the foot for added support.</p>

<p>Stability and Support</p>
<p>The midsole wraps up the foot at the heel and the midfoot to help keep it stable during side-to-side and diagonal movements. And seam-free overlays at the heel and forefoot minimise chafing while adding support.</p>

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Creation 15 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. A new model with great cushioning and less weight, the Wave Creation 15 features a DynaMotion fit and AP+ midsole.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Mizuno's revolutionary Infinity Wave provides unmatched cushioning, rebound and durability by reducing the shoes reliance on traditional midsole foam. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe.</p>

<p>Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage. The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry. This is further bolstered by AIRmesh that allows the shoe to maintain a high standard of breathability providing a cool, dry feel.</p>

<p>X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£104.99," ,

							<p>The GEL-EXCEL33 has been revamped to offer protection, flexibility, comfort and support in a more natural, stripped-back shoe. Perfect for serious runners, it has been designed to work with your foot, enhancing natural motion at every point in the stride.</p>

<p>It now features Fluid Axis Technology, allowing for a more natural motion of the foot by letting the subtalar joint rotate around its axis. It also has a Clutch Counter exoskelatal heel to provide improved support and a better fitting heel.</p>

<p>The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.</p>

<p>The full-length Guidance Line also promotes a more efficient run, encouraging optimum foot positioning from foot-down to toe-off. A lower, more flexible midsole gives you a more natural road feel and running experience, while a 10mm heel drop puts you in the best biomechanical position for your foot. This lightweight approach doesn't compromise on support or durability.</p>

<p>The individual components of the shoe work together for an Impact Guidance System that gives you a more comfortable step and an improved gait. There is a memory foam sockliner in the shoe to provide additional cushioning and the spongy layer between the shoe and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot.</p>

<p>The GEL Cushioning System, Personal Heel Fit and durable AHAR+ sole ensure that your foot stays protected, without adding any unnecessary weight to the shoe.

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.</p>

<p>The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.

							<p>The Nike Free Flyknit 4.0 Men's Running Shoe continues the tradition of Flyknit with a woven upper that conforms to the foot for breathable, lightweight comfort with each stride.

</ul><br>
<p>Flyknit Origins</p>
<p>Nike Flyknit was inspired by feedback from runners requesting a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability all in one layer was refined. The result was a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£88.00," ,

							<p>The Nike Free 3.0 Men's Running Shoe is designed for runners seeking the most flexible and natural ride, with an ultra-low, ultra-flexible midsole that offers the benefits of natural motion in a minimalist design.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove design - made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole - enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Ultra-Low Profile</p>
<p>The Nike Free 3.0 offers the most barefoot-like feel of the Nike Free family.</p>
<p>The ultra-low midsole features a 4mm offset from heel to forefoot height for an incredibly flexible, natural ride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Sock-Like Fit</p>
<p>An inner bootie hugs the foot for a snug, secure fit.</p>

<p>It's made of ultra-breathable engineered mesh that provides a dynamic, sock-like fit yet still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>The PureGrit is the trail option in the PureProject series, offering lightweight technologies off road.

A split in the midsole forefoot (the Toe Flex) allows the big toe to function independently and engage your natural balance.

							<p>The Nike Free 3.0 Women's Running Shoe is designed for runners seeking the most flexible and natural ride, with an ultra-low, ultra-flexible midsole that offers the benefits of natural motion in a minimalist design.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole - made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole - enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Ultra-Low Profile</p>
<p>The Nike Free 3.0 offers the most barefoot-like feel of the Nike Free family.</p>
<p>The ultra-low midsole features a 4mm offset from heel to forefoot height for an incredibly flexible, natural ride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Sock-Like Fit</p>
<p>An inner bootie hugs the foot for a snug, secure fit.</p>
<p>It's made of ultra-breathable engineered mesh that provides a dynamic, sock-like fit yet still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

							<p>The Asics Gel-Noosa Tri 8 is built for the serious competitor and celebrates the Iconic Noosa Triathlon festival held in Queensland Australia every November. It has been specifically designed using Triathlon DNA and is a full tilt racer of the highest pedigree delivering lightweight support and high performance with a twist of colour.</p>

<p>Features and Benefits:</p>

<p>With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.</p>

<p>The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement.</p>

<p>Featuring DuoMax - an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation.</p>

<p>The Solyte midsole is a proprietary cushioning material that provides an exceptionally lightweight midsole with excellent bounce-back and durability. Featuring DuoMax - an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation.</p>

<p>The Space Trusstic System is an advanced system that creates a pocket between the Trusstic System device and the midsole, allowing for greater midsole deformation and more efficient foot function. With Propulsion Trusstic that mimics connective tissue in the foot by creating tension as the foot enters propulsion stage it provides good energy.</p>

<p>This shoe will even perform in the wettest conditions. It is constructed from WetGrip RubberSponge, a blend of organic and non-organic components designed to enhance traction on wet surfaces. To add to this, the Wet Grip Rubber Outsole provides this extra traction on the outside of the shoe.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£69.99," ,

							<p>More minimal than the Nike Free 5.0+ and more cushioned than the Nike Free 3.0, the Nike Free 4.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening and flexibility benefits of natural motion without sacrificing underfoot protection or multi-surface traction.</p>

<p>Advanced Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole - made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole - enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Super-Low Profile</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a more barefoot-like feel than the Nike Free 5.0+, with a 6mm offset between heel and forefoot height for a blend of cushioning and flexibility.</p>

<p>Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Seamless and Breathable</p>
<p>The seamless upper provides exceptional comfort and fit with minimal no-sew overlays.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous version, the upper features large mesh panels on the midfoot that increase airflow for enhanced breathability.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£59.99," ,

There is Flexfilm technology in the upper to secure the foot on the platform throughout the gait cycle and a 4mm heel-to-toe offset encourages a more balanced running form.</p>

<p>One reason for this impressive fit is the strategically placed memory foam in the heel which provides a heel pocket, thus contributing to the comfort. In addition to this, the shoe's Hydrator lining provides next-to-skin comfort while wicking away moisture.</p>

							<p>The Nike Free TR III Ladies Training Shoe improves on its predecessor to deliver greater comfort and closer-to-barefoot training. The updated design combines enhanced training-specific flexibility and traction with lighter weight and a more modern upper - ideal for training at the gym or with Nike Training Club.</p>

<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>Deep flex grooves promote natural movement for a more barefoot-like feel. The upper is made of thin, lightweight materials with minimal seams to enhance multidirectional flexibility for natural range of motion.</p>

<p>Low-profile Comfort</p>
<p>The low-profile design lets you feel closer to the ground, with a Phylite midsole that provides lightweight cushioning and enough durability to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the overall weight of the shoe.</p>

<p>Breathable Support</p>
<p>Breathable foam in the upper and internal support straps in the lateral forefoot and medial arch offer training-specific support.</p>
<p>Raised foam in the arch adds even more support where you need it.</p>

<p>Reduced Lace Pressure</p>
<p>The new comfort tongue lays flat on top of the foot and uses layers of sandwich mesh to help reduce lace pressure for a comfortable fit.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>Secure Fit</p>
<p>Made with lightweight, breathable mesh, the full-length inner sleeve provides a sock-like fit that hugs the foot, but still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>Advanced flex grooves deliver exceptional range of motion.</p>

<p>Stability and Support</p>
<p>The midsole wraps up the foot at the heel and the midfoot to help keep it stable during side-to-side and diagonal movements. And seam-free overlays at the heel and forefoot minimise chafing while adding support.</p>

<p>This, the 2E version of the shoe, has a wider upper and sole to allow the bones of the foot to spread, preventing discomfort around the toes.</p>

<p>The DuoMax Support System consists of a dual density midsole positioned to enhance support and stability. There is extra cushioning and durability from the Solyte Midsole material; a lighter midsole compound than the standard EVA and SpeEVA midsoles that feature on other shoes.</p>

<p>Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury. Rearfoot GEL provides cushioning in all directions, absorbs impact forces and helps to stabilise the foot during heel contact. The GEL in the heel is left exposed in this case.</p>

<p>The Trusstic in the mid foot area provides stability whilst working in combination with the contoured midsole to help control torsion. AHAR+ on the outsole is placed in the heel to reduce wear and increase durability for those who do high mileage.

							<p>The Performance line form Vivobarefoot encourages you to run the way evolution intended. This shoe gives the wearer the sense of unrestricting freedom, but still with protection and traction from the surface below.</p>

<p>The Ultra is an amphibious running shoe. It can be used for cross training, runs along the beach, water sports, or any general exploration where you may come in contact with the water.</p>

<p>The anatomic VB performance last shape maximizes barefoot fit, feel and response, while the elastic cord and lock lacing system allows for a quick, secure and personalised fit.</p>

<p>The adaptability of these shows is portrayed in the fact that a full sock can be interchanged with the mesh tongue, for added puncture resistance or climate control. So if it's hot, cold, dry, wet, you'll have the shoe to do the job.</p>

<p>The dual-density perforated exo-skeleton upper, with hex-flex design, is an innovative advancement that provides fantastic comfort and a high performance.

<p>The new wrap tongue provides even greater comfort and the Ideal Heel has curvature in the heel to shift the contact point forward so that you land with more ground clearance under the middle of the heel, reducing internal stress. A split in the midsole forefoot (the Toe Flex) allows the big toe to function independently and engage your natural balance. Flexible materials then empower a more efficient push off during the propulsion phase.</p>

							<p>More minimal than the Nike Free 5.0+ and more cushioned than the Nike Free 3.0, the Nike Free 4.0+ Women's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening and flexibility benefits of natural motion without sacrificing underfoot protection or multi-surface traction.</p>

<p>Advanced Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole - made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole - enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Super-Low Profile</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a more barefoot-like feel than the Nike Free 5.0+, with a 6mm offset between heel and forefoot height for a blend of cushioning and flexibility.</p>

<p>Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Seamless and Breathable</p>
<p>The seamless upper provides exceptional comfort and fit with minimal no-sew overlays.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous version, the upper features large mesh panels on the midfoot that increase airflow for enhanced breathability.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>Raised foam in the arch adds even more support where you need it.</p>

<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

							<p>The Ultra Kane 3.0 is a running shoe designed for the runners who require additional stability and maximum cushioning; those who have a heavier stride. Extremely light and incredibly comfortable, this covers all the boundaries.</p>

<p>It utilises Z-bound technology in the midsole. This consists of a lightweight and resilient compound, responsible for the responsive ride. Z-bound has a very high-energy return and so the result is less weight and great response</p>

<p>The CarbonSpan Plus shank is lighter, stronger, and tuned to your running. It provides a smooth powerful toe off in the way that plastic would fail to do so.</p>

<p>To add to all this, the Zoot Ultra Fit Upper is a compression-like upper used on all Zoot footwear, and this is no different.

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£59.00," ,

							<p>More minimal than the Nike Free 5.0+ and more cushioned than the Nike Free 3.0, the Nike Free 4.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening and flexibility benefits of natural motion without sacrificing underfoot protection or multi-surface traction.</p>

<p>Advanced Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole - made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole - enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Super-Low Profile</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a more barefoot-like feel than the Nike Free 5.0+, with a 6mm offset between heel and forefoot height for a blend of cushioning and flexibility.</p>

<p>Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Seamless and Breathable</p>
<p>The seamless upper provides exceptional comfort and fit with minimal no-sew overlays.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous version, the upper features large mesh panels on the midfoot that increase airflow for enhanced breathability.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£49.99," ,

							<p>A runners' perfect match, the Nike LunarGlide+ 5 Men's Running Shoe is lighter than its predecessor and features updated Flywire technology and springy cushioning designed to go any distance.</p>

<p>Superior, Adaptive Fit</p>
<p>The seamless single-layer mesh upper with ultra-strong Flywire threads delivers a superior fit and feel, offering ventilation and support where you need it most. For an adaptive, glove-like fit, the updated Flywire wraps the midfoot and arch and integrates with the lace loops, tightening for a closer fit and reduced pressure on the top ridge of the foot.</p>

<p>Dynamic Support provides just the stability you need without the added weight or stiffness of a traditional medial post. A floating heel clip moves with the foot to add another level of support, moderating excessive rearfoot pronation.</p>

<p>Responsive Feel</p>
<p>The shoe's Lunarlon cushioning features a soft yet resilient foam core encased within a supportive foam carrier for lightweight, ultra-plush cushioning and springy response.</p>

							<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening benefits of natural motion, along with the cushioning, traction and underfoot protection of a traditional shoe.</p>

<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Low-Profile Feel</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a natural barefoot-like feel.</p>

<p>It features the highest offset offered by Nike Free running shoes, with an 8mm difference between heel and forefoot height for greater cushioning while still promoting a natural stride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Supportive Fit</p>
<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ is the most supportive of the Nike Free family thanks to ultra-light Flywire technology.</p>

<p>This latest version of Flywire consists of soft yet durable cables that wrap the midfoot and arch from underneath the foot for a glove-like, supportive fit that adapts to your stride.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>This, the 2E version of the shoe, has a wider upper and sole to allow the bones of the foot to spread, preventing discomfort around the toes.</p>

<p>The DuoMax Support System consists of a dual density midsole positioned to enhance support and stability. There is extra cushioning and durability from the Solyte Midsole material; a lighter midsole compound than the standard EVA and SpeEVA midsoles that feature on other shoes.</p>

<p>Forefoot GEL reduces the loading forces as the foot moves into propulsion, improving performance and minimising the risk of injury. Rearfoot GEL provides cushioning in all directions, absorbs impact forces and helps to stabilise the foot during heel contact. The GEL in the heel is left exposed in this case.</p>

<p>The Trusstic in the mid foot area provides stability whilst working in combination with the contoured midsole to help control torsion. AHAR+ on the outsole is placed in the heel to reduce wear and increase durability for those who do high mileage.

							<p>The Nike Flyknit Lunar2 Women's Running Shoe delivers the ideal blend of strength, support and comfort with an ultra-lightweight fit and soft, responsive Lunarlon cushioning.</p>

<p>Ultralight Support</p>
<p>The ultralight yet strong Flyknit upper is precisely engineered to deliver a comfortable and supportive fit. Made entirely of polyester yarn, it's a one-piece layer that's woven more openly in areas that need greater flexibility and tighter in areas that demand more support. The result is a formfitting and virtually seamless upper.</p>

<p>Secure Fit</p>
<p>Sturdy Flywire cables wrap the midfoot for added support. They work with the Dynamic Fit system, integrating with the shoe's laces for a secure, locked-down fit that moves with you.</p>

<p>Responsive Cushioning</p>
<p>Lunarlon cushioning provides a soft and responsive ride, featuring a resilient foam core with a bottomless foam carrier for a plush, comfortable feel.</p>

<p>Less Waste</p>
<p>To construct the single-layer Flyknit upper, polyester yarn is fed into a proprietary knitting machine that creates little to no waste, making the shoe incredibly efficient to produce.</p>

<p>More Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Knit tongue integrated into the upper for enhanced comfort</li>
<li>Pull tab on the heel for easy on and off</li>
<li>Fitsole sockliner conforms to the shape of your foot for support</li>

<li>Environmentally preferred rubber lugs on the outsole follow a forefoot pressure map for an efficient stride</li>
<li>Reflective elements for enhanced visibility in low light</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Flyknit Origins</p>
<p>Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners seeking a shoe with an ultralight, second skin-like fit. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability-all in one layer-was refined, resulting in a featherweight and virtually seamless upper.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£79.99," ,

							<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening benefits of natural motion, along with the cushioning, traction and underfoot protection of a traditional shoe.</p>

<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Low-Profile Feel</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a natural barefoot-like feel.</p>

<p>It features the highest offset offered by Nike Free running shoes, with an 8mm difference between heel and forefoot height for greater cushioning while still promoting a natural stride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Supportive Fit</p>
<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ is the most supportive of the Nike Free family thanks to ultra-light Flywire technology.</p>

<p>This latest version of Flywire consists of soft yet durable cables that wrap the midfoot and arch from underneath the foot for a glove-like, supportive fit that adapts to your stride.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

							<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening benefits of natural motion, along with the cushioning, traction and underfoot protection of a traditional shoe.</p>

<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Low-Profile Feel</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a natural barefoot-like feel.</p>

<p>It features the highest offset offered by Nike Free running shoes, with an 8mm difference between heel and forefoot height for greater cushioning while still promoting a natural stride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Supportive Fit</p>
<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ is the most supportive of the Nike Free family thanks to ultra-light Flywire technology.</p>

<p>This latest version of Flywire consists of soft yet durable cables that wrap the midfoot and arch from underneath the foot for a glove-like, supportive fit that adapts to your stride.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>One reason for this impressive fit is the strategically placed memory foam in the heel which provides a heel pocket, thus contributing to the comfort. In addition to this, the shoe's Hydrator lining provides next-to-skin comfort while wicking away moisture.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£76.99," ,

							<p>The GEL-EXCEL33 has been revamped to offer protection, flexibility, comfort and support in a more natural, stripped-back shoe. Perfect for serious runners, it has been designed to work with your foot, enhancing natural motion at every point in the stride.</p>

<p>It now features Fluid Axis Technology, allowing for a more natural motion of the foot by letting the subtalar joint rotate around its axis. It also has a Clutch Counter exoskelatal heel to provide improved support and a better fitting heel.</p>

<p>The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.</p>

<p>At the core of the shoe is the revolutionary Propulsion Trusstic. It mimics the plantar fascia in the arch of your foot, harnessing your foot's energy to propel you forward.</p>

<p>The full-length Guidance Line also promotes a more efficient run, encouraging optimum foot positioning from foot-down to toe-off. A lower, more flexible midsole gives you a more natural road feel and running experience, while a 10mm heel drop puts you in the best biomechanical position for your foot. This lightweight approach doesn't compromise on support or durability.</p>

<p>The individual components of the shoe work together for an Impact Guidance System that gives you a more comfortable step and an improved gait. There is a memory foam sockliner in the shoe to provide additional cushioning and the spongy layer between the shoe and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot.</p>

<p>The GEL Cushioning System, Personal Heel Fit and durable AHAR+ sole ensure that your foot stays protected, without adding any unnecessary weight to the shoe. A lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides both impact support and additional fitting around the heel.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£74.00," ,

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£74.99," ,

							<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ Men's Running Shoe provides the foot strengthening benefits of natural motion, along with the cushioning, traction and underfoot protection of a traditional shoe.</p>

<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove outsole made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Low-Profile Feel</p>
<p>A low-profile midsole delivers a natural barefoot-like feel.</p>

<p>It features the highest offset offered by Nike Free running shoes, with an 8mm difference between heel and forefoot height for greater cushioning while still promoting a natural stride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Supportive Fit</p>
<p>The Nike Free 5.0+ is the most supportive of the Nike Free family thanks to ultra-light Flywire technology.</p>

<p>This latest version of Flywire consists of soft yet durable cables that wrap the midfoot and arch from underneath the foot for a glove-like, supportive fit that adapts to your stride.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.</p>

<p>The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike. Rubber forefoot plate can be used on the track or the trail.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£82.49," ,

There is also BioMoGo DNA cushioning for customised comfort according to your weight, gait and pace.</p>

<p>The PureGrit is the trail option in the PureProject series, offering lightweight technologies off road. The outsole has a more aggressive, multi-directional lug pattern for greater grip; capable with dealing with a variety of surfaces. The concave shape delivers better balance by splaying out upon impact and creating more surface area for ground contact.</p>

<p>The new wrap tongue provides even greater comfort and the Ideal Heel has curvature in the heel to shift the contact point forward so that you land with more ground clearance under the middle of the heel, reducing internal stress. A split in the midsole forefoot (the Toe Flex) allows the big toe to function independently and engage your natural balance.

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£73.00," ,

This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.</p>

<p>The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.

<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure-measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li></ul>						</div>",£80.99," ,

							<p>A runners' perfect match, the Nike LunarGlide+ 5 Men's Running Shoe is lighter than its predecessor and features updated Flywire technology and springy cushioning designed to go any distance.</p>

<p>Superior, Adaptive Fit</p>
<p>The seamless single-layer mesh upper with ultra-strong Flywire threads delivers a superior fit and feel, offering ventilation and support where you need it most. For an adaptive, glove-like fit, the updated Flywire wraps the midfoot and arch and integrates with the lace loops, tightening for a closer fit and reduced pressure on the top ridge of the foot.</p>

<p>Dynamic Support</p>
<p>Dynamic Support provides just the stability you need without the added weight or stiffness of a traditional medial post. A floating heel clip moves with the foot to add another level of support, moderating excessive rearfoot pronation.</p>

<p>Responsive Feel</p>
<p>The shoe's Lunarlon cushioning features a soft yet resilient foam core encased within a supportive foam carrier for lightweight, ultra-plush cushioning and springy response.</p>

							<p>Supportive, smooth and harmonious, the Paradox makes running fun for runners who need high levels of stability.</p>

<p>Mizuno have used biomechanical research to determine the difference between male and female gaits. As a result, the midsole and outsole have been engineered specifically for their respective gender to improve ride, comfort and performance.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology provides cushioning and stability that can be adapted for different types of runners.</p>

<p>A removable ortholite insock provides even more premium comfort, cushioning and durability.</p>

<p>The Dynamotion Fit uses biomechanic and motion picture technology to design a blueprint and develop a shoe that works with your foot through the gait cycle. Smooth Ride engineering minimises the rapid rates of acceleration and deceleration of the foot during transition, creating as smooth a ride as possible.</p>

<p>Mizuno Intercool is a full-length midsole ventilation system that reduces the heat and humidity that can build up inside the shoe. Using X10, incredibly durable carbon rubber, allows for longer wear in high impact areas and supplements traction at the heel strike.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£85.99," ,

							<p>The Nike Free 3.0 Men's Running Shoe is designed for runners seeking the most flexible and natural ride, with an ultra-low, ultra-flexible midsole that offers the benefits of natural motion in a minimalist design.</p>

<p>Superior Flexibility</p>
<p>The flex groove design made up of deep cuts along the length and width of the midsole enhances natural range of motion, encourages a smooth, efficient stride and helps maintain stability.</p>

<p>Ultra-Low Profile</p>
<p>The Nike Free 3.0 offers the most barefoot-like feel of the Nike Free family.</p>
<p>The ultra-low midsole features a 4mm offset from heel to forefoot height for an incredibly flexible, natural ride. Plus, the Phylite material in the midsole is tough enough to double as an outsole, dramatically reducing the shoe's overall weight.</p>

<p>Sock-Like Fit</p>
<p>An inner bootie hugs the foot for a snug, secure fit.</p>

<p>It's made of ultra-breathable engineered mesh that provides a dynamic, sock-like fit yet still allows for easy on and off.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>

<p>The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement whilst asymmetrical lacing creates an anatomically correct lacing environment that reduces potential for irritation and provides improved comfort and fit.</p>

<p>With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.</p>

<p>Featuring DuoMax - an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation. Biomorphic Fit technology allows the upper of the shoe to move in harmony with the foot, giving more comfort while in motion.

<p>The ComforDry Sockliner provides cushioning performance and anti-microbial properties for a cooler, drier and healthier environment. A Solyte Midsole, a spongy layer between the sole and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot, while a lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides additional fitting and support around the heel.</p>

<p>This shoe will even perform in the wettest conditions. It is constructed from WetGrip RubberSponge, a blend of organic and non-organic components designed to enhance traction on wet surfaces. To add to this, the Wet Grip Rubber Outsole provides this extra traction on the outside of the shoe.</p>

<p>The Heel Clutching System features an Exoskeletal heel counter to provide improved support and create an improved heel fitting environment.</p>

<p>A supreme level of comfort is provided through an asymmetrical lacing design that reduces the potential for irritation and provides excellent comfort and fit.

							<p>The Nike Flyknit Lunar2 Men's Running Shoe delivers the ideal blend of strength, support and comfort with an ultra-lightweight fit and soft, responsive Lunarlon cushioning.</p>

<p>Ultralight Support</p>
<p>The ultralight yet strong Flyknit upper is precisely engineered to deliver a comfortable and supportive fit. Made entirely of polyester yarn, it's a one-piece layer that's woven more openly in areas that need greater flexibility and tighter in areas that demand more support. The result is a formfitting and virtually seamless upper.</p>

<p>Secure Fit</p>
<p>Sturdy Flywire cables wrap the midfoot for added support. They work with the Dynamic Fit system, integrating with the shoe's laces for a secure, locked-down fit that moves with you.</p>

<p>Responsive Cushioning</p>
<p>Lunarlon cushioning provides a soft and responsive ride, featuring a resilient foam core with a bottomless foam carrier for a plush, comfortable feel.</p>

<p>Less Waste</p>
<p>To construct the single-layer Flyknit upper, polyester yarn is fed into a proprietary knitting machine that creates little to no waste, making the shoe incredibly efficient to produce.</p>

							<p>The Hoka One Stinson Evo Running Shoe features a unique design that combines lightweight, rolling performance, an oversize EVA midsole, control and stability. The result is a more powerful faster ride that's suitable for road and trail use.</p>

<p>A unique rolling motion delivers superior underfoot performance with 50% rockering profile to provide a smooth, energy efficient stride transition from the heel strike to the push off. It is this progressive motion that propels you forward with each and every strike of the foot.</p>

<p>Oversized midsole with up to 2.5x the volume of EVA compared to standard running shoes provides outstanding impact absorption and a highly comfortable underfoot feel. This oversized approach ensures a natural stride whether on smooth road surfaces or the most uneven trails.</p>

<p>Control is provided by the unique patented bucket seat design which is recessed between 20mm to 30mm into the midsole to firmly support the heel and allowing precision striking and optimum foot stabilisation.</p>

<p>A 35% wider platform is designed to enhance underfoot stability and works to counteract the height of the shoe ensuring that you are comfortable and confident with every strike. Flexible, reinforced sidewalls, precision fit and close lacing systems to enhance the feeling of stability and support.</p>

<p>These shoes are so lightweight they help to alleviate fatigue over longer distances and are ideal for those who crave high-levels of performance without a weight penalty.</p>

							<p>The Asics Gel Kayano is the legend of the running shoe with each year bringing a new evolution and the 20th version once again delivers an outstanding ride for the moderate over-pronator. As an IGS development the transition through the 3 phases of gait is very smooth and efficient with an enhanced upper fit and improved forefoot comfort.</p>

<p>Features and Benefits:</p>

<p>The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.</p>

<p>The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement. With Guidance Line technology a vertical flex groove decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.</p>

<p>With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.</p>

<p>The ComforDry sockliner provides the optimum cushioning performance that creates a cooler, drier and healthier shoe environment. The use of a discrete eyelet improves upper fit whilst reducing possible irritation stage whilst asymmetrical lacing creates an anatomically correct lacing environment that reduces potential for irritation and provides improved comfort and fit.</p>

<p>The Solyte midsole is a proprietary cushioning material that provides an exceptionally lightweight midsole with excellent bounce-back and durability. DuoMax is an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation.</p>

<p>The lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides improved support and fitting around the heel, while Biomorphic fit in the upper utilises stretchy material to reduce bunching, which can lead to blisters and irritation, when the shoe moves.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£125.99," ,

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Inspire 10 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly.</p>

<p>This version of the shoe is lighter, with more support, more comfort and more cushioning.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance.</p>

<p>Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>The ap+ compound increases cushioning and comfort levels that will last thanks to improved durability.VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry.</p>

<p>AIRmesh allows the shoe to maintain a high standard of breathability providing a cool, dry feel.X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li></ul>						</div>",£94.49," ,

							<p>The GEL-EXCEL33 has been revamped to offer protection, flexibility, comfort and support in a more natural, stripped-back shoe. Perfect for serious runners, it has been designed to work with your foot, enhancing natural motion at every point in the stride.</p>

<p>It now features Fluid Axis Technology, allowing for a more natural motion of the foot by letting the subtalar joint rotate around its axis. It also has a Clutch Counter exoskelatal heel to provide improved support and a better fitting heel.</p>

<p>The FluidRide is the latest evolution in Asics Midsole technology. It provides the ultimate in bounce back and cushioning characteristics while remaining light in weight.</p>

<p>At the core of the shoe is the revolutionary Propulsion Trusstic. It mimics the plantar fascia in the arch of your foot, harnessing your foot's energy to propel you forward.</p>

<p>The full-length Guidance Line also promotes a more efficient run, encouraging optimum foot positioning from foot-down to toe-off. A lower, more flexible midsole gives you a more natural road feel and running experience, while a 10mm heel drop puts you in the best biomechanical position for your foot. This lightweight approach doesn't compromise on support or durability.</p>

<p>The individual components of the shoe work together for an Impact Guidance System that gives you a more comfortable step and an improved gait. There is a memory foam sockliner in the shoe to provide additional cushioning and the spongy layer between the shoe and upper absorbs shock and cushions the foot.</p>

<p>The GEL Cushioning System, Personal Heel Fit and durable AHAR+ sole ensure that your foot stays protected, without adding any unnecessary weight to the shoe. A lightweight heel counter on the outside of the upper provides both impact support and additional fitting around the heel.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£112.49," ,

							<p>The Hoka One Mafate 3 Trail Running Shoe is an ultra-performance shoe designed to help you glide over the harshest of terrain. This shoe combines lightweight, rolling performance, an oversize EVA midsole, control and stability to make sure that all the bases are covered whether you're training or racing.</p>

<p>The Mafate 3 shoe has an oversized midsole construction of 2,2x EVA volume of conventional running shoes to provide the ultimate protection. The oversize midsole ensures cocoon-like protection and provides unparalleled running comfort with cushioning that absorbs up to 25% of impact.</p>

<p>A unique rolling motion delivers superior underfoot performance with a 50% rockering profile to provide a smooth, energy efficient stride transition from the heel strike to the push off. It is this progressive motion that propels you forward with each and every strike of the foot.</p>

<p>Control is provided by the unique patented bucket seat design which is recessed between 20mm to 30mm into the midsole to firmly support the heel and allowing precision striking and optimum foot stabilisation.</p>

<p>The Quick-Lace system helps to secure the foot with rigid grommets and a seamless shaft. For lovers of normal laces, simple laces are provided with the pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Features double mesh thickness that is ultra-breathable and highly durable to provide comfort and protection.</p>

<p>These shoes are so lightweight they help to alleviate fatigue over longer distances and are ideal for those who crave high-levels of performance without a weight penalty.</p>

							<p>Supportive, smooth and harmonious, the Paradox makes running fun for runners who need high levels of stability.</p>

<p>Mizuno have used biomechanical research to determine the difference between male and female gaits. As a result, the midsole and outsole have been engineered specifically for their respective gender to improve ride, comfort and performance.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology provides cushioning and stability that can be adapted for different types of runners.</p>

<p>A removable ortholite insock provides even more premium comfort, cushioning and durability.</p>

<p>The Dynamotion Fit uses biomechanic and motion picture technology to design a blueprint and develop a shoe that works with your foot through the gait cycle. Smooth Ride engineering minimises the rapid rates of acceleration and deceleration of the foot during transition, creating as smooth a ride as possible.</p>

<p>Mizuno Intercool is a full-length midsole ventilation system that reduces the heat and humidity that can build up inside the shoe. Using X10, incredibly durable carbon rubber, allows for longer wear in high impact areas and supplements traction at the heel strike.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li></ul>						</div>",£103.49," ,

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Creation 15 is based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. A new model with great cushioning and less weight, the Wave Creation 15 features a DynaMotion fit and AP+ midsole.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Mizuno's revolutionary Infinity Wave provides unmatched cushioning, rebound and durability by reducing the shoes reliance on traditional midsole foam. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Sensor Point provides both stability and traction utilising a revolutionary suspension system which relies on studs that connect the Wave Plate directly to the ground.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe.</p>

<p>Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design. Designed to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage. The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>Intercool technology relieves heat and humidity build up by incorporating a full-length ventilation system in the sole of the shoe allowing for the heat to escape through a system of ventilation channels keeping you cool and dry. This is further bolstered by AIRmesh that allows the shoe to maintain a high standard of breathability providing a cool, dry feel.</p>

<p>X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£104.99," ,

<p>Flyknit Origins</p>
<p>Nike Flyknit was inspired by feedback from runners requesting a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability all in one layer was refined. The result was a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£98.99," ,

This is an instant classic for serious runners.</p>

<p>The Impact Guidance System enhances the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off improving the efficiency and comfort of your foot-strike and movement. With Guidance Line technology a vertical flex groove decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.</p>

<p>The Heel Clutching System features an Exoskeletal heel counter to provide improved support and create an improved heel fitting environment. The Discrete Heel Unit takes the Impact Guidance System to a new level by creating the highest degree of shock attenuation and stability.</p>

<p>The Propulsion Trusstic mimics connective tissue in the foot by creating tension as the foot enters propulsion stage whilst asymmetrical lacing creates an anatomically correct lacing environment that reduces potential for irritation and provides improved comfort and fit.</p>

<p>The Cuprothermo metallic film in the upper retains heat in cold weather and releases heat in warm weather making an adaptable shoe that will help you in all weather conditions. AHAR stands for High Abrasion Rubber, placed in critical areas of the outsole for exceptional durability.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Long Sleeve Top with Zipper features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym. This top features a mock neck for added coverage in cold conditions with a zip for adjustability depending on the temperature.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 85%</li><li>Spandex 15%</li></ul>						</div>",£64.99," ,

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.</p>

<p>The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike. Rubber forefoot plate can be used on the track or the trail.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li></ul>						</div>",£98.99," ,

<p>Flyknit Origins</p>
<p>Nike Flyknit was inspired by feedback from runners requesting a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability all in one layer was refined. The result was a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.</p>

<p>Nike Free Origins</p>
<p>After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.</p>

<p>The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic Material </li></ul>						</div>",£98.99," ,

							<p>The Mizuno Wave Rider 17 provides great cushioning combined with a silky smooth transition, based on biomechanical research into the differences between men's and women's gait. This updated version of the shoe is lighter and faster, but with the same level of cushioning and U4ic technology.</p>

<p>U4ic is a new type of midsole. It runs and rides the same comfort and performance as ap+ and other premium midsoles, but is considerably lighter, leaving you to run easier.</p>

<p>The new cushioning comes from SR Touch. This new, advanced cushioning material is lighter, absorbs shock and has fast rebound properties, keeping the transition smooth and fast.</p>

<p>Mizuno constructs the Midsole/Outsole of each gender differently to improve the ride, performance and comfort. Smooth Ride Engineering provides the ultimate in comfort, feel and performance. Designed by Mizuno's Sozo Studio, Smooth Ride Engineering is the next generation in performance footwear design, to minimise the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the foot through the phases of the running cycle by reducing shock and increasing flexibility. This allows for a supremely comfortable run through a smoother ride.</p>

<p>Mizuno Wave technology is unique in that it combines cushioning and stability perfectly. The wave plate provides excellent cushioning by dispersing the force of impact across a larger surface area minimising the risk of shock related injury. Wave plate constructed from Pebax Rnew, which is made from plant based oil which is sustainable and produces less carbon while retaining all performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Dynamo Fit was developed by the revolutionary Sozo Studio through analysing high speed video that shows how shoes distort in the collar and heel counter during the gait cycle resulting in loss of fit and causing heel slippage.</p>

<p>The DynaMotion Fit system allows the upper of the shoe to interact with the movement of the foot relieving the stress on the upper which causes the distortion and results in fit being maintained throughout the full range of the movement.</p>

<p>VS-1 technology provides excellent shock absorption and cushioning by absorbing shock and resisting compression-set, extending the cushioning life of the shoe. X-10 provides durability and traction utilising the most durable carbon rubber from Mizuno that allows for longer wear in high impact areas and provides more traction at heel strike. Rubber forefoot plate can be used on the track or the trail.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Rubber </li><li>Synthetic </li></ul>						</div>",£98.99," ,

							<p>Celebrating the 30th anniversary of Oakley performance eyewear, the Heritage Collection salutes the evolution of a revolution by bringing back vintage rarities for a limited time.</p>

<p>Designed specifically for demanding sporting activity, this revolutionary eyewear lets athletes change lenses depending on their environment, thanks to Switchlock Technology. Switchlock lets you adapt your vision and changes lenses quickly and hassle-free. The simple switch mechanism makes the process quick and easy, and the lens is held securely in place without uneven pressures that can bend it and distort your vision.</p>

<p>The lightweight yet durable frame is made of O Matter. This is shaped with surge ports to maintain a cooling flow of air. Interchangeable nose pads let you achieve a comfortable, customizable fit, and the earsocks are made of the same sport-optimized Unobtainium to increase grip when you sweat. Uneven pressure points are eliminated because its Three-Point Fit holds the frame comfortably in place while keeping the lens in precise optical alignment, rather than hooking over your ears.</p>

<p>Radarlock comes in an Oakley Soft Vault case that lets you store an extra lens, and each frame comes with two lenses: one for bright days and one for low-light conditions.</p>

<p>Features in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oakley Switchlock interchangeable lens technology for fast and easy lens changing</li>
<li>Durability and all-day comfort of lightweight, stress-resistant O Matter frame material</li>
<li>Integrated surge ports to channel airflow for the comfort of cooling</li>

							<p>SKINS Men's Coldback Long Sleeve tops supercharge your performance naturally, whatever sport you play. Coldblack treatment reduces the absorption of the sun's rays meaning that the fabric heats up less and stays cooler by up to 5 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>In addition SKINS dynamic gradient compression accelerates your blood flow to deliver more oxygen to your core muscles for more power and endurance while our Memory MX Fabric over the spine and around scapula and obliques provide constant, controlled compression and unrestricted movement to help you avoid the muscle damage you sustain in action, but only notice when you cool down.</p>

<p>With coldblack technology, memory MX fabric and dynamic gradient compression, you'll notice improved core body control and power, as well as less post-exercise muscle soreness.</p>

<p>400 Fit: A super comfortable fit, more precise, targeted Gradient Compression and in some cases, a greater range of leg lengths for men and different body shapes for women.</p>

<p>50+ UV Protection: SKINS was born in Australia, so we know a thing or two about exerting ourselves in the sun. Our fabrics have a UV protection of 50+, which means you can get out and train harder without worrying about the sun related risks.</p>

<p>Dynamic Gradient Compression: Increases oxygen delivery to active muscles while in motion and reduces lactic-acid build-up for more power and less recovery time.</p>
<p>Memory MX: Memory MX fabric contains a unique high stretch elastomeric yarn â"" which returns to its original shape no matter how much stress you put it under.</p>

<p>Moisture Management: Keeping you dry through advanced wicking is inherent in all SKINS fabrics - moisture is drawn away from your skin, so you stay dry and comfortable.</p>

<p>Muscle Focus: Uniquely wrapping and supporting your key muscle groups to reduce movement and focus direction for less vibration in your muscles, less soft tissue damage and less soreness after exercise.</p>

<p>Warp Knit: The fabric in SKINS is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to give superior performance - Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch â"" instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Polyamide Nylon 76%</li><li>Eleastane 24%</li></ul>						</div>",£69.99," ,

							<p>You don't stop breathing after the game.</p>

<p>The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time.</p>

<p>Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line.</p>

<p>Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again!</p>

<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

<p>Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",£69.99," ,

							<p>You don't stop breathing after the game. The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time. Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line. Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again! SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery. If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery. GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster. FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability. MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations. TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature. ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances. SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia! Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged. Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",£69.99," ,

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 85%</li><li>Spandex 15%</li></ul>						</div>",£49.99," ,

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>The benefits of increased oxygen to your muscles during sport are obvious. But recovering muscles need oxygen too. Stepping into SKINS RY400 range after a workout enhances the circulation in abused legs, arms and shoulders - reducing recovery time.</p>

<p>Your muscles don't stop working once you've crossed the finish line. . .</p>

<p>Forget massages or comfy slippers. For maximum recovery, pull on your RY400 garments after sport. A recovering body has different compression needs to one that's taut, in-motion and being pushed to the limits. Based on the revolutionary 400 fit, our new RY400 range can help prevent muscle fatigue, eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and improve recovery. You can even wear SKINS whilst you sleep to speed up recovery, so you wake up fresh and ready to do it all over again!</p>

<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

<p>Superior construction: The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon 76%</li><li>Spandex 24%</li></ul>						</div>",£59.99," ,

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Tank Top features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Short Sleeve Top features muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

							<p>SKINS help improve the supply of oxygen to active muscles. This enhances natural performance, increases the turnaround of metabolic waste and reduces the build up of lactic acid - meaning faster recovery.</p>

<p>If the compression level is too high it can restrict blood flow and cause friction between muscles. If it's too low it won't provide any benefit at all. SKINS engineered gradient compression ensures the correct level of pressure is provided in the right places to enhance circulation and deliver more oxygen to your muscles. The SKINS 400 series features dynamic gradient compression and bio-mechanically placed Memory MX fabric, providing even more precise compression during activity and recovery.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' - offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>MOISTURE: All SKINS fabrics actively draw moisture away from your skin - keeping you dry even in the most gruelling situations.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE: SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

<p>ODOUR: SKINS have antimicrobial elements built into the fabric - they can't be washed out, no matter how often SKINS are worn. These elements discourage the growth of bacteria by absorbing odour-causing substances.</p>

<p>SUN: Wearing SKINS is equal to 50+ UV protection - preventing harsh UV rays from penetrating the skin. When it comes to being sun smart, you can trust SKINS - they're from Australia!</p>

							<p>The SKINS 400 series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that 400 series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into 400 Series garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for 400 Series garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. In addition features moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

<p>SKINS fabrics help optimise your body temperature in both warm and cool conditions. Muscles warm up quickly through enhanced circulation, whilst the superior wicking promotes evaporative cooling to help maintain a more constant body temperature.</p>

							<p>Sweat is too precious to throw it all away; our skin needs moisture to cool itself down. When moisture evaporates from the skin an evaporative cooling process takes place that we use to maintain the optimal body temperature.</p>

<p>Traditional technical base layers absorb moisture in its entirety so then the body steps up its sweat production. The result: Water, minerals and salts are lost. This boxer short is different. The globally unique and patented 3D-BionicSphere System leaves a light film of sweat on the skin. The body is effectively and naturally cooled as long as it's sweating. If sweating stops, the insulation function kicks in and less energy is demanded for temperature regulation, which leaves more energy for your activity.</p>

							<p>The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS' scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Shorts feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

<p>The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching. In addition moisture wicking, temperature management and 50+ UV protection.</p>

The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability. The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged. Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn. The SKINS logo features more prominently along with a higher density signature SKINS contrast stitching.

This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.</p>

<p>GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.</p>

<p>FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.</p>

<p>The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.</p>

<p>Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.</p>

HOLBROOK is a timeless classic that echoes the screen heroes from the 1940s, 50s and 60s, the icons who inspired youth with their own brand of defiance.</p>

							<p>Designed specifically for demanding sporting activity, this revolutionary eyewear lets athletes change lenses depending on their environment, thanks to Switchlock Technology. Switchlock lets you adapt your vision and changes lenses quickly and hassle-free. The simple switch mechanism makes the process quick and easy, and the lens is held securely in place without uneven pressures that can bend it and distort your vision.</p>

<p>This frame has fluid contours and sleek lines to add velocity to an already renowned design.</p>

<p>The lightweight yet durable frame is made of O Matter. This is shaped with surge ports to maintain a cooling flow of air. Interchangeable nose pads let you achieve a comfortable, customizable fit, and the earsocks are made of the same sport-optimized Unobtainium to increase grip when you sweat. Uneven pressure points are eliminated because its Three-Point Fit holds the frame comfortably in place while keeping the lens in precise optical alignment, rather than hooking over your ears.</p>

<p>Radarlock comes in an Oakley Soft Vault case that lets you store an extra lens, and each frame comes with two lenses: one for bright days and one for low-light conditions.</p>

<p>With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.</p>

<p>The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.</p>

<li>Distance (km, mi) can be set and measured in several ways. Training distance tells you the distance traveled during a training session. Lap distance tells you the distance of one lap. Trip distance tells you the distance from the latest trip reset. Total distance is the distance accumulated since the last reset.</li>
<li>Race Pace allows you to set a target speed/pace for a certain distance. It then helps pacing the run or ride by showing the current speed/pace and by telling in time, how much you are behind or ahead of the set target</li>
<li>You can define your target zones for a training session based on speed. When you are out of the preset zones, the training computer will give a visual and audible alarm.</li>

							<p>This is part of a layering system inlaid with smart, new technology to help cyclists perform at their best. All these cycle shorts, compression jerseys and base layer tops feature SKINS dynamic gradient compression to help you power through the miles.</p>

<p>This series can accurately determine compression levels required while athletes are in motion. Different sports require different levels of compression in different areas and it's here that this series excels. SKINS studied exactly where on the body compression should be applied, and how much compression is needed during activity. The results are applied into these garments to create the new SKINS Dynamic Gradient Compression.</p>

<p>SKINS performed a 3D body scan of hundreds of athletes, amateur and professional, of all shapes and sizes. From the 800,000 measurements taken of each athlete, SKINS established 400 key fitting points. This provides the blueprint for these garments.</p>

<p>In addition these garments feature Memory MX fabrics to provide controlled, consistent elasticity and perfectly focused support, complementing the body's natural movement and reducing the risk of injury</p><p>Material</p><ul><li>Nylon </li><li>Spandex </li></ul>						</div>",£28.99," ,

							<p>The Gatorade G Series Pro Training Package has been put together to provide you with the perfect 3 stage performance nutrition to help you train for any event.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<p>2 x Gatorade 1ltr Bottle</p>
<p>5 x 01 PRIME (mixed berry-118ml pouch)</p>
<p>1 x 02 PERFORM powder tub (lemon-makes 5 litres)</p>
<p>5 x 03 RECOVER (mixed berry-500ml bottle)</p>

<p>The G Series Pro is an advanced development by Gatorade that consists of nutritional support at the three different stages of physical activity: before, during and after. The series has come about through the work done at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute and the feedback of world class athletes.</p>

<p>For the three stages there are three products. PRIME is for before, PERFORM is for during and RECOVER is for after; all are catered very specifically for their respective tasks.</p>

<p>Gatorade 01 PRIME:</p>
<p>Gatorade 01 Prime is a concentrated formula of pre-workout fuel containing B vitamins to help with energy metabolism as part of a daily diet. The inclusion of isomaltulose reduces the blood glucose rise in comparison to glucose alone. It is less viscous than a Gel and less fluid than a drink.</p>
<p>Drink Gatorade 01 Prime 15 minutes prior to the start of training or competition for pre-exercise fuel without caffeine.</p>

<p>Carbohydrate: 24g (100 calories)</p>
<p>Electrolytes: 110mg Sodium and 35mg Potassium</p>
<p>Vitamins B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid) and B6 (Pyridoxine)</p>

<p>Gatorade 02 PERFORM:</p>
<p>The fluid helps maintain hydration, and then it is the carbohydrates and sodium that help ensure that fuel stores are maintained as well as electrolyte balance, all of which contributes to maintaining performance for longer.</p>
<p>Intense workouts and endurance sports require this blend of carbohydrates, electrolytes and fluid to help athletes compete. Dehydration is a danger for every athlete at every level, but Gatorade G Series Pro 02 Perform is designed to support you every step of the way.</p>

<p>Carbohydrate: 30g (125 calories)</p>
<p>Electrolytes: 250mg Sodium and 60mg Potassium</p>

<p>Gatorade 03 RECOVER:</p>
<p>This is a protein, carbohydrate and electrolyte recovery drink formulated with the consistency of a thirst quencher to rehydrate, stimulate muscle protein synthesis and start to replenish glycogen stores after exercise.</p>
<p>The Recover Drink performs three main tasks. Firstly the inclusion of 16g of protein helps rebuild muscles after workouts, then carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores and lastly the combination of fluid and sodium helps rehydration as well as fluid retention. The inclusion of sucrose also ensures for rapid absorption.</p>
<p>Drink within 30 minutes of exercise to get essential amino acids from protein needed to help facilitate muscle rebuilding.</p>

<p>Protein: 16g</p>
<p>Carbohydrates: 14g</p>

							<p>The RCX5 is for triathletes, runners, cyclists and endurance athletes who want to optimize their training.</p>

<p>This Run version of the monitor is different to the Bike version and standard version in that it includes the s3+ stride sensor. Some of the features of this include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Measures average stride length. Runners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length increases as speed increases. Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride length is the natural one; the one that feels most comfortable.</li>
<li>Running cadence measures how many times either your right or left foot hits the ground in one minute. Running cadence is measured as steps per minute. With this feature you can sharpen your cadence and make your ground contact time shorter. This will help you to find a balance between leg power and leg speed.</li>
<li>Race Pace allows you to set a target speed/pace for a certain distance. It then helps pacing the run or ride by showing the current speed/pace and by telling in time, how much you are behind or ahead of the set target.</li>
<li>Running Index is based on heart rate and speed data measured during the run. It gives daily information about your performance level, both aerobic fitness and running economy. Improvement in running efficiency indicates improved economy of running performance.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>As well as these features, there are also some more generic features common with all RCX5 models.</p>

<ul>
<li>ZoneOptimizer adjusts your heart rate zones, making every session more effective</li>
<li>Sport profiles guarantee swift switch between different sports</li>
<li>Improves performance with endurance training programs, downloadable from polarpersonaltrainer.com with the Polar DataLink</li>

The robust design and easy operations also make it suited for other water sports.</p>

<p>Being GPS-enabled, the Forerunner 910XT even captures the path you travelled so you can view it later on a map in our free online community, while the Garmin Connect feature can help you analyze your open water swimming and adjust your technique as needed.</p>
<p>Whether training or racing, every second counts, so the 910XT makes it easy and seamless to transition between sports. The auto multisport feature lets you switch sport modes with just one press of a button, so no time is lost in transition. The optional quick release mount allows you to move the 910XT easily from wrist to bike.</p>

<p>On land, Forerunner 910XT offers many of the features expected on cycling computers and sport watches to accurately capture your time, distance, speed or pace. It incorporates a barometric altimeter for highly accurate elevation data, including ascent, descent and grade. Configurable data fields let you customize multiple training pages for each sport. Set up vibration alerts to give a silent nudge when you hit a split and there is up to 20 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>For advanced training, the 910XT is compatible with ANT+ sensors, including the optional speed/cadence sensor for cycling or premium heart rate monitor (included in the other model). Track your weight, body fat, body water and six other measurements when using the 910XT with the Tanita BC-1000 body composition scale. The readings are stored on Forerunner 910XT, then automatically sent to Garmin Connect when in range of your computer.</p>

<p>And for those data-driven athletes, the 910XT also is compatible with ANT+ power meters, such as Vector the pedal-based power meter.</p>

<p>Garmin Connect enables you to see your activity on a map and view detailed metrics. You also can use Connect to plan new routes, create and schedule custom workouts and explore activities from other users. Through the magic of ANT+ wireless technology and the tiny USB stick that comes with the 910XT, your workout data automatically transfers to your computer when in range. Garmin Connect is Mac and Windows compatible.</p>

							<p>The Garmin Forerunner 15 is an easy to use GPS running watch with heart rate. Run with all your heart. Forerunner 15 captures essential stats from your run like time, distance and pace. When paired with a heart rate strap, it also records your heart rate and heart rate zone so you'll know when you hit your target. Training with heart rate also allows you to monitor when you need to rein it in and when you can push yourself harder.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracks distance, pace, heart rate and calories</li>
<li>Activity tracking counts steps and calories and reminds you when it's time to move</li>

<li>Save, plan and share your activities at Garmin Connect</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Monitor Your Activity Between Runs: Want to track the steps you take throughout your day when you're not working out? Now you can, without wearing a separate activity tracking device. Forerunner 15 counts your steps and the calories you burn all day. When you upload your data to Garmin Connect, this allows you to monitor your progress toward fitness goals and see overall fitness trends. Forerunner 15 also reminds you when it's time to move if you've been sitting for more than an hour. When you get that cue to move, just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the inactivity indicator.</p>

<p>Motivation by the Mile: Forerunner 15 has an auto lap function that automatically alerts you when you complete each mile, giving you a friendly beep and a backlit screen that flashes your time for that mile. When you complete your run and save it, you'll see a summary of how you did, including your total time, distance, average pace and calories. Forerunner 15 even lets you know when you achieve a personal record, like your fastest mile or longest run to date.</p>

<p>Train Indoors or Out: For outdoor runs, Forerunner 15 uses GPS to accurately record your time, pace and distance. To track distance and pace when you hit the treadmill or an indoor track, just pair Forerunner 15 with an optional foot pod, which attaches to the laces of your shoe.</p>

<p>Wear it All Day: You won't have to worry about charging Forerunner every night. The rechargeable battery will last up to 5 weeks in watch/activity tracking mode or 8 hours when using it with GPS on your outdoor runs. Forerunner 15 has a water rating of 5 ATM (50 metres), which means it resists rain and sweat and can even join you for a swim.</p>

<p>Ideal for those who want to know if they're improving their fitness or burning fat. So if you want clear training guidance and an easy start to heart rate-based training, the FT7 is for you.</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature which tells you during a training session if the main effect of your training is fat burning or fitness improvement. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.</li>
<li>Polar OwnCal calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training. This feature allows you to follow the kilocalories expended during one training session and cumulative kilocalories expended during several training sessions.</li>
<li>Polar OwnCode: Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only. Coding prevents interference from other training computers.</li>
<li>Training Load: This feature is available in Polar software. When you transfer training results from your training computer to polarpersonaltrainer.com, you can follow your training load and recovery in the training diary. Continuous monitoring of training load and recovery will help you recognize personal limits, avoid over- or undertraining, and adjust training intensity and duration according to your daily and weekly targets</li>

<p>1+ year battery life, water resistance and connects to Garmin Connect so you can</p>
<p>Save, plan and share progress.</p>

<p>You already know the active steps you take now can improve your overall wellness today, tomorrow and well into your future. And while it seems simple to get out of that chair more often and move, making it stick is another matter. That's where Vivofit can turn good intentions into lifelong habits. It's the only fitness band that greets you with a personalized daily goal, tracks your progress and reminds you when it's time to move.</p>

<p>Vivofit learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, Vivofit will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. You can earn virtual badges and view your progress on Garmin Connect.</p>

<p>Tells Time and Time to Move</p>

<p>Research shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body's production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, vivofit knows. A red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you've been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar.</p>

<p>Keep Moving</p>

<p>When you're ready to take the next steps toward better health, Vivofit has additional features to keep you motivated. Use a heart rate monitor with Vivofit to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information for any fitness activity, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym. At Garmin Connect, you can join online challenges with other Vivofit users or start your own competition with friends to compete for virtual badges and bragging rights.</p>

<p>Always On</p>

<p>Vivofit follows your progress 24/7, and it can stay on for more than a year without a battery change. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and Vivofit will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. The Vivofit band is water-resistant, so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free.</p>

							<p>For active exercisers who are serious about training hard, the FT40 offers clear guidance to monitor fitness levels and help you to maximise your training.</p>
<p>The Polar FT40 is packed with features to enhance your training including an EnergyPointer that determines if the main effect of your training is fitness improvement or fat burning. The Polar Fitness test measures your aerobic fitness at rest and tells you your progress and also displays the calories you've burned.</p>
<p>Comes with comfortable textile transmitter and coded heart rate transmission to avoid cross-talk as well as visual and audible alarms when you're pushing too hard.</p>

<p>Delve deeper into the features:</p>
<p>Measure your heart rate and define target zones suited to your training. In Polar software or during strength training, heart rate can be displayed as a graphical trend, visually indicating the measurement of the work your heart does throughout exercise. Achieve the optimum intensity by setting targets based on your heart rate; when you're pushing too hard and are out of your preset zones, the training computer gives you a visual and audible alarm. You can set the target zone for your training as beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, or as a percentage of your heart rate reserve (HRR%).</p>

<p>EnergyPointer is an easy-to-use feature that allows you to achieve the optimum balance between improving fitness and burning fat. EnergyPointer visually indicates the center point between these two training effects, so when you are below that point, you are improving fat burning, and above that point, you are improving your aerobic fitness.</p>

<p>Once you're race ready, you can also put yourself to the test by taking the Polar Fitness Test that measures your aerobic fitness at rest in just five minutes. The test is based on heart rate and heart rate variability at rest combined with personal information and the results can be broken down to give you total control.</p>
<p>Other essentials while exercising include Polar OwnCal, which calculates the number of kilocalories expended during training and Polar OwnCode, a coded transmission that picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only and prevents interference from other training computers.</p>

<p>The Polar FT40 keeps all of your training in memory helping you towards your long-term goals. A weekly history gathers your weekly training data while all of this information can be aggregated to keep you on track during the workout.</p>
<p>Once you hit your peak, the press of a button locks you to that zone and combines with the ZonePointer to monitor and alert you when you're falling short or exceeding it. HeartTouch is also incorporated for button free operation of wrist unit, leaving you to concentrate on reaching your goals.</p>

							<p>The Garmin Vivofit is a fitness band that moves at the pace of your life.</p>
<p>This is a device that learns your activity level and assigns a personalized daily goal. It displays steps, calories, distance and monitors sleep.</p>

<p>The Vivofit pairs with heart rate monitor for fitness activities and features a</p>
<p>1+ year battery life, water resistance and connects to Garmin Connect so you can</p>
<p>Save, plan and share progress.</p>

<p>You already know the active steps you take now can improve your overall wellness today, tomorrow and well into your future. And while it seems simple to get out of that chair more often and move, making it stick is another matter. That's where Vivofit can turn good intentions into lifelong habits. It's the only fitness band that greets you with a personalized daily goal, tracks your progress and reminds you when it's time to move.</p>

<p>Vivofit learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, Vivofit will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. You can earn virtual badges and view your progress on Garmin Connect.</p>

<p>Tells Time and Time to Move</p>

<p>Research shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body's production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, vivofit knows. A red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you've been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar.</p>

<p>Keep Moving</p>

<p>When you're ready to take the next steps toward better health, Vivofit has additional features to keep you motivated. Use a heart rate monitor with Vivofit to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information for any fitness activity, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym. At Garmin Connect, you can join online challenges with other Vivofit users or start your own competition with friends to compete for virtual badges and bragging rights.</p>

<p>Always On</p>

<p>Vivofit follows your progress 24/7, and it can stay on for more than a year without a battery change. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and Vivofit will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. The Vivofit band is water-resistant, so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free.</p>

<p>Get Connected</p>
<p>With the touch of one button, you can wirelessly sync Vivofit with Garmin Connect to see a complete picture of your progress, join online challenges and earn virtual badges for extra motivation. It's so simple to get started. After you are set up, access our free online community from your computer or on your compatible mobile device with the Garmin Connect Mobile app.</p>

							<p>The Garmin Forerunner 15 is an easy to use GPS running watch with heart rate. Run with all your heart. Forerunner 15 captures essential stats from your run like time, distance and pace. When paired with a heart rate strap, it also records your heart rate and heart rate zone so you'll know when you hit your target. Training with heart rate also allows you to monitor when you need to rein it in and when you can push yourself harder.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracks distance, pace, heart rate and calories</li>
<li>Activity tracking counts steps and calories and reminds you when it's time to move</li>
<li>Compatible with foot pod for recording distance indoors</li>
<li>Up to 8 hours of battery life with GPS on or 5 weeks in watch/activity tracking mode</li>
<li>Save, plan and share your activities at Garmin Connect</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Monitor Your Activity Between Runs: Want to track the steps you take throughout your day when you're not working out? Now you can, without wearing a separate activity tracking device. Forerunner 15 counts your steps and the calories you burn all day. When you upload your data to Garmin Connect, this allows you to monitor your progress toward fitness goals and see overall fitness trends. Forerunner 15 also reminds you when it's time to move if you've been sitting for more than an hour. When you get that cue to move, just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the inactivity indicator.</p>

<p>Motivation by the Mile: Forerunner 15 has an auto lap function that automatically alerts you when you complete each mile, giving you a friendly beep and a backlit screen that flashes your time for that mile. When you complete your run and save it, you'll see a summary of how you did, including your total time, distance, average pace and calories. Forerunner 15 even lets you know when you achieve a personal record, like your fastest mile or longest run to date.</p>

<p>Train Indoors or Out: For outdoor runs, Forerunner 15 uses GPS to accurately record your time, pace and distance. To track distance and pace when you hit the treadmill or an indoor track, just pair Forerunner 15 with an optional foot pod, which attaches to the laces of your shoe.</p>

<p>Wear it All Day: You won't have to worry about charging Forerunner every night. The rechargeable battery will last up to 5 weeks in watch/activity tracking mode or 8 hours when using it with GPS on your outdoor runs. Forerunner 15 has a water rating of 5 ATM (50 metres), which means it resists rain and sweat and can even join you for a swim.</p>

<p>Get Connected: With a simple connection to your Mac or PC, you can upload your activities to our free online fitness community, Garmin Connect. Here, you can see your run on a map, get more detail on each mile, see a daily summary of your activities and share with friends. You can also join online challenges and earn virtual badges for extra motivation.</p>

<li>Polar OwnCode: Coded heart rate transmission automatically locks in a code to transmit your heart rate to the training computer. The training computer picks up your heart rate from your transmitter only. Coding prevents interference from other training computers.</li>
<li>HR-based Target Zones: You can define your target zones for a training session based on heart rate to help define the right intensity. When you are out of the preset zones, the training computer will give a visual and audible alarm.</li>

<p>When the knee is flexed the Magic Power Band preserves energy consumption, thus allowing for greater explosive power when it's time to extend.</p>

<p>Either side of the knee cap is covered in Stable Contoured Structure, which provides greater joint stability. This is supported by a donut-shaped silicone, combined with high-density knitted fabric, which improves patella stability.</p>

							<p>The CHO PAT Knee Strap is designed to give relief from chondromalacia (irritated knee cap). The strap functions dynamically as the knee bends and straightens.</p>

<p>Pressure on the tendon below the knee cap helps guide the knee cap in the groove, and it is this that improves tracking and assists in spreading pressure uniformly over the surface area. In addition, the strap elevates the knee cap slightly which relieves harmful pressure.</p>

<p>Made to comfortable for all-day wear, this strap helps proper tracking of patella and relieves harmful pressure in the same area.</p>

<ul>
<li>CHONDROMALACIA is caused by improper tracking of the patella, causing excessive force or pressure to wear the under-surface of the patella. This leads to irritation of a portion of the knee cap, inflammation, degeneration and pain.</li>
