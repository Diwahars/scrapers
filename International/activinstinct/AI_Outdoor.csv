							Tifosi is the Italian word for ""super-enthusiast"", and so provide eyewear that is comfortable, hard-wearing and high performing for a range of outdoor activites.

The lenses themselves are made from Grilamid TR-90; a homopolyamide nylon characterized by an extremely high alternative bending strength, low density, and high resistance to chemical and UV damage.

Knowing that you'll be competing while wearing them, the glasses have been designed to increase grip when in contact with sweat. Hydrophilic rubber resists aging and UV breakdown as well as providing a no-slip fit at the rubber ear and nose pieces.

There is ventilation to increase the airflow and reduce fogging, and the adjustable temples top this pair off, allowing for a customizable fit and increased wearing comfort.

With interchangeable lens, these glasses are specifically suited to golfers. The Tifosi Optics GT lens tint features ""object illumination"", which enhances your ability to pick up a ball in flight by providing a balance of target and background brightness. Whether you are at net or tee, the GT tint is designed to help keep your eye on the ball.

The EC lens tint is designed for athletes seeking an edge in distinguishing terrain details. The hue of EC increases light contrast by filtering the blue light spectrum that is responsible for optical blurring and decreased contrast in bright light conditions. Use this lens tint for spotting the subtle breaks of a putting green or the lines of your local single track.

Hi-Tec's expertise in designing, developing and manufacturing Tec-Proof construction products, delivers truly functional waterproof/breathable footwear for versatile usage.

The backbone of Tec-Proof construction is the philosophy of allowing the materials to do their respective jobs. With Tec-Proof, only the seams of the upper are sealed with waterproof cement.

All treads used on such product are also waterproof threads which do not wick moisture. Meshes are waterproofed with a membrane backer. However, the waterproof leather is allowed to breathe, which increases the moisture vapour permeability of the entire shoe. This process essentially ensures that the upper is truly waterproof, breathable and durable.

Hi-Tec has perfected this technology and is able to deliver this waterproof product with performance and value, ensuring that a wide range of consumers can have a great experience in the outdoors and stay dry.

All treads used on such product are also waterproof threads which do not wick moisture. Meshes are waterproofed with a membrane backer. However, the waterproof leather is allowed to breathe, which increases the moisture vapour permeability of the entire shoe. This process essentially ensures that the upper is truly waterproof, breathable and durable.

Hi-Tec has perfected this technology and is able to deliver this waterproof product with performance and value, ensuring that a wide range of consumers can have a great experience in the outdoors and stay dry.

							Compression garments enhance performance, delay fatigue, lower the risk of injury and speed up
recovery times. Based on fabrics and technology originally developed for medical compression products, they help to eliminate muscle and joint pain by supporting the muscles and reducing shock and vibrations.

The Compressport US calf guard is uniquely enhanced through the integration of a layer of 220 silicon gel buds surrounding the interior of the guard above the ankle. This optimises shock absorption, greatly reduces muscle oscillation and provides increased support to the Achilles tendon.

After exercise the Compressport US calf guard boosts your venous return, reducing the accumulation of toxins while increasing oxygenation to the muscles. The reduction in lactic acid build-up coupled with its shock absorption properties protects you from muscular fatigue and damage.

Muscles benefit from improved oxygenation, helping to reduce the possibility of cramps and injuries. The Compressport fabric also optimises heat exchange and wicks away moisture, helping to regulate your body temperature.

							The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts bring the benefits of their medical-grade compression to the
widest audience yet. Whatever your sport or physical activity, these shorts deliver optimum
compression to the thighs in total comfort.

The Multi Sport Underwear Shorts are designed to be worn underneath regular shorts or kit and are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate
targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and
reduces muscle vibration.

Targeted Compression: the seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.

Waistband: the Jacquard elastic waistband is designed for comfort and has silicone grip inside to keep the shorts in position.

Push-Up Zone: the shorts provide exceptional support to the groin area while offering maximum freedom of movement and comfort. The Push-Up Zone is woven from 100% pure natural fibres: cashmere is thermo-regulatory; copper has antifungal and antibacterial properties to prevent odours and irritation of the mucous membranes; soft wood pulp is highly absorbent and breathable.

Flat-Lock Seams: the shorts are assembled with the latest generation flat-lock seams. Solid and
discreet, they avoid chafing.

Ergofit: the fibre and shape of the shorts are designed to fit every curve of your body perfectly, maximising efficiency and comfort.

Hydrophobic: the water-repellent fibre wicks moisture away and evacuates sweat without absorbing it. No more uncomfortable heavy, damp clothing that irritates and doesn't dry.

Ultralight: a second-to-none combination of high-performance, compression and weight, the technology used by Compressport makes these shorts the lightest true compression shorts ever made.

Thermoregulation: the fabric's unique weave enhances air circulation enables a perfect balance
between the inside and outside of the shorts, so body temperature remains stable with no sudden surges or drops.

Massaging Fibre: each movement triggers a micro massage providing a sensation of lightness and wellbeing.

Anti-Bacterial: the SANITIZED treatment helps prevent the growth of bacteria and naturally fights odours.

OEKO-TEX-certified: the innovative fibre used has the world-renowned OEKO-TEX inspection

							To meet the increasing demand from its many trail running athletes, Compressport now offers a unique range of compression shirts and shorts designed specifically for trail running, incorporating many new trail-specific features.

The Trail Underwear Shorts, designed to be worn underneath regular shorts, are seamless, ultra lightweight, breathable and optimise postural alignment. They incorporate targeted thigh compression which enhances blood flow, improves hip/buttock alignment and reduces muscle vibration.

The seamless Compressport fibre is exclusively woven on medical compression machines, allowing for millimetre-precision compression graduation, targeted around the thighs. This enables the stimulation of blood flow and oxygenation, evacuation of toxins, good knee alignment, shock absorption and the reduction of muscle vibration thus delaying muscle fatigue.

							Super lightweight without compromising support, comfort or overall performance. The Gel-Fitwalk Lyte features forefoot and rear foot cushioning as well as DuoMax system for maximum support to keep you running further and faster.

With rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning systems employed it attenuates shock during impact and toe-off phases allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle.

AHAR+ is incorporated, a thinner and lighter version of Asics High Abrasion Resistance rubber. It is placed on heavy contact areas of the outsole to reduce excessive wear. DuoMax is an ASICS proprietary system consisting of two or more different density midsole materials, designed to help correct the degree and velocity of pronation. Meanwhile an spEVA midsole improves bounce back characteristics and decreases midsole breakdown.

The Trusstic system is employed to reduce the weight of the sole unit while retaining the structural integrity of the shoe so you get excellent support combined with lightweight durability. In addition this model also includes True Width Fitting, a width fitting that not only has more upper material to accommodate for the wider foot. It also has a wider midsole base which allows the bones of the foot to spread and prevent any discomfort around the toes.MaterialPlastic Ahar+ Duomax Duomax System Gel Cushioning Gel-Fitwalk Lyte SpEVA 						",6699,7837.83,ASICS Gel-Fitwalk Lyte (D) Ladies Walking Shoes,ASICS,"UK3,UK3.5,UK4.5",http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m05/225719/27913648-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							Enjoy breathtaking views and rekindle your passion for adventure by exploring the outdoors in the award-winning Hi-Tec V-Lite Altitude Ultra Luxe WPi boots.

The Altitude Ultra Luxe WPi, featuring innovative ion-mask technology that masterfully manages water, has been a talking point for enthusiasts worldwide. It was awarded 'highly commended' status in the Camping Magazine 2010 awards and received an impressive 71% in a test by Which magazine, pitting it second place out of the 11 boots trialled. In the expert user trial, the boot received the maximum 5 star rating and also top-scored in the waterproof test.

Ion-Mask is a process that can treat any shoe but it is important to note that it is not just a waterproof technology, it is a water management technology.

Shoes engineered as Ion-Mask (HPI) have all the benefits of the Ion-Mask process but are not designed to be waterproof. Instead of trying to keep water out, they welcome water. Typical product here would be sandals or trail running shoes with open mesh materials which become much improved after the process.

HPI shoes will be quicker drying because they absorb less water, they will also remain lighter as a result and stay clean longer than conventional untreated equivalent models.

V-Lite is a revolutionary vertical build concept that strips away as much weight as possible without sacrificing performance or durability. No one specific technology can be credited for the light weight of this collection, but rather the creative combination of innovative materials and construction.

Pittards WR100X full grain British leather is specially
engineered to shrug off moisture on the outside while
allowing perspiration to escape from the inside, without
any change in the comfort or performance of the product.
The unique WR100X tanning process increases the
water repellent properties by limiting water uptake
into the fibre structure, while these same permanent
properties allow the leather to breathe by letting the
vapour created by perspiration pass through the fibre
structure in the other direction.
The key benefits of Pittards WR100X are:

Increased water repellent properties
Proven sweat management
Leather retains excellent fit and unique softness
High strength, abrasive resistant and durable.

The Ortholite foam insole provides fantastic conditioning due to its open cell polyurethane construction. It also allows the moisture to cause blisters and odour to evaporate. The Vibram outsole that this shoe features has two primary functions. Firstly it creates a lug pattern, with no lugs under the arch to make for greater flexibility, to provide fantastic stability, regardless of the conditions. Secondly, the rubber compound ensures fantastic traction in a variety of different conditions and temperatures.

							Teva has built the Jordanelle 2 with 250g of low loft Thinsulate in its removable liner and waterproof shell materials, so there is no sacrifice on any warmth, but at the same time it weighs in at about half the weight of other boots. And the Jordanelle 2 will compress down to the size of any normal shoe, so there is no need an extra suitcase just for your boots. So the next time you find yourself in front of the wall of brown boots at the store, just tell yourself: there is another way.

When the cold is out, most rubber hardens up and loses its flexibility, turning your shoes into ice skates. White Spider Rubber was made to stay soft and flexible in freezing temperatures, leaving the ice-skating to the pros.

							Adventurers will know that water presents a paradox. It is the source of a year-round playground, but it simultaneously poses a year-round problem. Anyone who has ever slipped on a patch of ice or been forced to deal with soaking wet socks can attest to this duality.

Teva has two fundamental responsibilities to cover in the shoes they create: to play and to protect. People play in the water, but also see need to be protected from it. This is a delicate balance, and one that Teva deliver.

The Toachi 2 is the evolution of the Open Toachi sport sandal. Lighter, leaner and more streamlined, the Toachi 2 does not compromise when it comes to performance. A Shoc Pad in the heel reduces fatigue, while a full-length TPU shank wraps up into the upper to keep your foot steady as you take your adventures to wet environments.

Spider Rubber produces a versatile rubber compound that successfully blends high friction and good durability, whether on wet and dry terrain.
The Shoc Pad blended polyurethane/EVA unit in the heel cup evenly transfers the energy of impact throughout the footbed and away from the heel. This energy return then provides greater spring with each forefoot push-off.

Despite the water, Microban Zinc, an environmentally friendly zinc technology, restricts the growth of odour causing bacteria and fungus, while built in anti-microbial product protection provides continuous odour control that won't wash off or wear away.

TPU Drain Frame Platform wraps around the midsole creating anchor points that integrate into the upper allowing your foot to securely lock onto the bottom unit.

These sandals also boast a series of drainage ports with monofilament mesh screens that allow water to escape directly through the bottom of the shoe while preventing debris from entering. The added bonus is that these ports also work in reverse, allowing air to flow through for additional ventilation and comfort in even the hottest environments.MaterialRubber EVA 						",8249,9651.33,TEVA Toachi 2 Ladies Sport Sandal,TEVA,"UK4,UK5,UK6,UK7,UK8",http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m03/218003/47913925-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

The Ortholite insole allows air to circulate around the foot, while moving moisture away from the body. It offers long term cushioning and comfort and is extremely lightweight, so has no detrimental effect on the performance.

Split leather sockliner further enhances the comfort through creating a soft dry feeling when walking barefoot in the shoe.

Key technical features include dual board construction with a leisure outsole, microfiber lining and adjustable plastic buckle closure combined with flexible elastic construction. The upper is constructed full grain leather for both quality and comfort.

MBT's have been designed to stimulate the postural and stabilising musculature of the whole body. Revolutionary sole construction utilising the interplay of the Shank, PU midsole and Masai Sensor places the body in a natural instability that can otherwise only be achieved by walking barefoot on natural, uneven surfaces. The natural instability activates the body's supporting muscle system and has positive effects on the entire body.

The positive effects of wearing MBTs includes significantly improving your gait and posture whilst relieving stress in your joints and back. Additionally they exercise a large number of muscles, whether you're walking or standing.

							Where is it written that winter boots have to be heavy, boring and unpackable? Teva have built the Chair 5. With 250g of 3M Thinsulate insulation in its removable liner and waterproof shell materials, the Chair 5 doesn?t sacrifice any warmth, but at the same time it weighs in at about half the weight of other boots. And the Chair 5 will compress down to the size of any normal shoe, so you don?t need an extra suitcase just for your boots. So the next time you find yourself in front of the wall of brown boots at the store, just tell yourself: there is another way.

When the cold is out, most rubber hardens up and loses its flexibility, turning your shoes into ice skates. White Spider Rubber was made to stay soft and flexible in freezing temperatures, leaving the ice-skating to the pros.

With 3M Thinsulate insulation, freezing feet is one part of winter you can forget thanks to the years of research that 3M has conducted in the field.

							Where is it written that winter boots have to be heavy, boring and unpackable? Teva have built the Chair 5. With 250g of 3M Thinsulate insulation in its removable liner and waterproof shell materials, the Chair 5 doesn?t sacrifice any warmth, but at the same time it weighs in at about half the weight of other boots. And the Chair 5 will compress down to the size of any normal shoe, so you don?t need an extra suitcase just for your boots. So the next time you find yourself in front of the wall of brown boots at the store, just tell yourself: there is another way.

When the cold is out, most rubber hardens up and loses its flexibility, turning your shoes into ice skates. White Spider Rubber was made to stay soft and flexible in freezing temperatures, leaving the ice-skating to the pros.

With 3M Thinsulate insulation, freezing feet is one part of winter you can forget thanks to the years of research that 3M has conducted in the field.

The upper is made from waterproof leather for support and durability, and there is also lightweight, rustproof hardware. The i-Shell upper enhances both support and fit, ensuring it remains durable and protective, while allowing your foot to breathe and stay comfortable.

3D Counter Balance technology ensures there is stability to go with the cushioning. It generates a smoother, more central pressure that means there is less chance of injury. It also reduces pronation and delivers a more efficient gait cycle.

							A highly technical one-of-a kind hiking boot, this is comprised of three different PU density soles that are co-injected and moulded together. The high-density front portion secures and guarantees maximum stability. The medium-density heel reduces shock and resulting fatigue during take-off and landing.

Further shock absorption is obtained through the four strategically placed low-density cylinders that are linked from the outside to the midsole. Gripped with dual-density moulded rubber Vibram outsole, the arch area uses a high-density rubber to maximise support over the long-haul, while the balance of the outsole has self-cleaning lugs designed for optimum traction on varying terrain.

The revised and patented Micro Pulley uses high specification materials and components (zinc-alloy, brass, steel and Zamac) to offer effortless lacing with maximum durability, all while remaining incredibly light. Because each pulley works independently with reduced lace abrasion, the result is improved overall performance, fit and comfort.

							The Skins A200 range is the evolution of the pioneering Original collection. Built on SKINS? scientifically proven engineered gradient compression, the SKINS A200 Thermal Tights feature muscle wrapping support for stronger support that provides heightened performance. This garment is designed for those that are passionate about being active whether it running, playing team sports or hitting the gym.

GRADIENT COMPRESSION: SKINS gradient compression has been engineered to provide the correct level of surface pressure to specific body parts, enhancing circulation and delivering more oxygen to active muscles. Increased circulation also helps eliminate lactic acid build up and other metabolic wastes so you can go harder for longer and recover faster.

FOCUS: SKINS wrap and support key muscle groups which reduces vibration and helps maintain muscle alignment. The seams on SKINS are strategically placed to act as 'anchor points' offering focused support and stability.

The fabric in skins is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to giver superior performance. Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch - instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression. Some other compression brand use circular kit which has a natural stretch, making it hard to maintain the correct level of compression. Circular knit fabrics are also less durable and likely to run if snagged.

Warp knit construction has a 'float line' between loops to aid moisture management. Multiple yarns are used for added strength and to eliminate running if the fabric is torn.

400 Fit: A super comfortable fit, more precise, targeted Gradient Compression and in some cases, a greater range of leg lengths for men and different body shapes for women.
50+ UV Protection: SKINS was born in Australia, so we know a thing or two about exerting ourselves in the sun. Our fabrics have a UV protection of 50+, which means you can get out and train harder without worrying about the sun related risks.

Dynamic Gradient Compression: Increases oxygen delivery to active muscles while in motion and reduces lactic-acid build-up for more power and less recovery time.

Memory MX: Memory MX fabric contains a unique high stretch elastomeric yarn â"" which returns to its original shape no matter how much stress you put it under.
Moisture Management: Keeping you dry through advanced wicking is inherent in all SKINS fabrics - moisture is drawn away from your skin, so you stay dry and comfortable.

Muscle Focus: Uniquely wrapping and supporting your key muscle groups to reduce movement and focus direction for less vibration in your muscles, less soft tissue damage and less soreness after exercise.

Warp Knit: The fabric in SKINS is warp knitted using multiple fine quality yarns to give superior performance - Warp knit fabrics have no natural stretch â"" instead, the spandex mix ensures specific levels of elasticity and perfectly controlled compression.

With the F.L.A.S.H. system you can fully adjust the length of your pack shoulder straps quickly and easily. An easy-access Velcro closure at the back lets you regulate your ideal strap length. F.L.A.S.H. is used in conjunction with the Aeroflex suspension system.

The redesigned Aeroflex Easy Adjust is an all-rounder of backpack suspension systems. Vaude used a new Aeroflex-mesh and has improved the Easy Adjust adjustment mechanism. It's no longer adjusted using a connecter behind the mesh but rather by pulling on adjustment loops to increase tension on the mesh across the frame. Tension on the mesh is released by loosening the two quick-release buckles. This provides continuous adjustment of the mesh tension: when you want a lot of ventilation, tighten the mesh. When you want better balance of the load, loosen the mesh.

With a body-hugging fit, anatomical, extra softly padded shoulder straps, and plenty of great features make the Tacora an outdoor-woman's favourite.

When you want better balance of the load, loosen the mesh.

It includes 360 Heel Support technology, delivering optimum heel fit, a Mammut-developed vibram Reptilia Technology sole, Torsion Reinforcement, and Mammut Rolling Concept for safety and comfort in alpine sports.

The patented Mammut Base Fit lacing system transfers the force of the lacing to the sole, making it free of pressure points, and this prevents the foot from slipping around inside the boot. The highly breathable GORE-TEX Performance Comfort Footwear membrane guarantees waterproof credentials. Additional features include extensive use of protective Liquid Rubber reinforcements and a rugged board-lasted construction.

The GORE-TEX treatment ensures the boot is well protected, providing durability against the elements, as well as allowing the boot to breathe throughout, thus keeping your feet more comfortable.

							Adventurers will know that water presents a paradox. It is the source of a year-round playground, but it simultaneously poses a year-round problem. Anyone who has ever slipped on a patch of ice or been forced to deal with soaking wet socks can attest to this duality.

Teva has two fundamental responsibilities to cover in the shoes they create: to play and to protect. People play in the water, but also see need to be protected from it. This is a delicate balance, and one that Teva deliver.

The Toachi 2 is the evolution of the Open Toachi sport sandal. Lighter, leaner and more streamlined, the Toachi 2 does not compromise when it comes to performance. A Shoc Pad in the heel reduces fatigue, while a full-length TPU shank wraps up into the upper to keep your foot steady as you take your adventures to wet environments.

Spider Rubber produces a versatile rubber compound that successfully blends high friction and good durability, whether on wet and dry terrain.

The Shoc Pad blended polyurethane/EVA unit in the heel cup evenly transfers the energy of impact throughout the footbed and away from the heel. This energy return then provides greater spring with each forefoot push-off.

Despite the water, Microban Zinc, an environmentally friendly zinc technology, restricts the growth of odour causing bacteria and fungus, while built in anti-microbial product protection provides continuous odour control that won't wash off or wear away.

TPU Drain Frame Platform wraps around the midsole creating anchor points that integrate into the upper allowing your foot to securely lock onto the bottom unit.

These sandals also boast a series of drainage ports with monofilament mesh screens that allow water to escape directly through the bottom of the shoe while preventing debris from entering. The added bonus is that these ports also work in reverse, allowing air to flow through for additional ventilation and comfort in even the hottest environments.MaterialRubber EVA 						",8249,9651.33,TEVA Toachi 2 Men's Sport Sandal,TEVA,,http://products.activinstinct.com/y2011/m03/217886/34952919-n.jpg,http://assets.activinstinct.com/images/language/en/btn-click-to-zoom.gif

							The Vaude Brenta 25 Backpack is a high tech, spacious hiking backpack for longer tours. With large stretch outer pockets for easy access of bottles, boxes, glasses case, tissues and other small gear. Perfect fit thanks to the Aeroflex Easy Adjust suspension system and the F.L.A.S.H. shoulder strap adjustment.

With the F.L.A.S.H. system you can fully adjust the length of your pack shoulder straps quickly and easily. An easy-access Velcro closure at the back lets you regulate your ideal strap length. F.L.A.S.H. is used in conjunction with the Aeroflex suspension system.

The redesigned Aeroflex Easy Adjust is an all-rounder of backpack suspension systems. Vaude used a new Aeroflex-mesh and has improved the Easy Adjust adjustment mechanism. It's no longer adjusted using a connecter behind the mesh but rather by pulling on adjustment loops to increase tension on the mesh across the frame. Tension on the mesh is released by loosening the two quick-release buckles. This provides continuous adjustment of the mesh tension: when you want a lot of ventilation, tighten the mesh. When you want better balance of the load, loosen the mesh.

							With free £20 Birdseye Select Mapping Voucher - The BirdsEye™ select voucher allows Garmin users to choose customized sections of raster-based maps for compatible handheld devices, download them straight from Garmin's website and integrate them with existing maps.

Garmin’s BirdsEye Select database contains high-resolution Ordnance Survey images for a true representation of your surroundings. BirdsEye Select works with your Garmin handheld maps to add real-world detail to roads, buildings and the terrain for a greater appreciation of your environment.

Only Garmin could make the eTrex better. The new eTrex 10 retains the core functionality, rugged construction, affordability and long battery life that made eTrex the most dependable GPS device available. We improved the user interface and added a worldwide basemap, paperless geocaching and added support for spine mounting accessories. You'll recognize the name. You'll recognize the quality. But the eTrex 20 is an entirely new device - a device that only Garmin could offer.

See The Way
eTrex 20 has an enhanced 2.2 in monochrome display that's easy to read in any lighting situation. Its easy-to-use interface means you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors and less time searching for information. Both durable and waterproof, eTrex 10 features the legendary toughness that's built to withstand the elements - be it dust, dirt, humidity or water, none of which are a match for this legendary navigator.

Find Fun
eTrex 10 features paperless geocaching by supporting GPX files for downloading geocaches and details straight to your unit. Visit OpenCaching.com to start your geocaching adventure. By going paperless, you're not only helping the environment but also making your geocaching more fun. eTrex 10 stores and displays all the information you need, including location, terrain, difficulty, hints and descriptions, which means no more manually entering coordinates and paper print outs. Simply upload the geocache to your unit and start hunting for caches.

Keep Your Fix
With its high-sensitivity, EGNOS-enabled GPS receiver and HotFix satellite prediction, eTrex 10 locates your position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons. The advantage is clear - whether you're in deep woods or just near tall buildings and trees, you can count on eTrex 10 to help you find your way when you need it the most.

Go Global
The new eTrex series is the first-ever consumer-grade receivers that can track both GPS and GLONASS satellites simultaneously. GLONASS is a system developed by the Russian Federation that will be fully operational in 2012. When using GLONASS satellites, the time it takes for the receiver to lock on to a position is (on average) approximately 20 percent faster than using GPS. And when using both GPS and GLONASS, the receiver has the ability to lock on to 24 more satellites than using GPS alone.

							Celebrating the 30th anniversary of Oakley performance eyewear, the Heritage Collection salutes the evolution of a revolution by bringing back vintage rarities for a limited time.

Designed specifically for demanding sporting activity, this revolutionary eyewear lets athletes change lenses depending on their environment, thanks to Switchlock Technology. Switchlock lets you adapt your vision and changes lenses quickly and hassle-free. The simple switch mechanism makes the process quick and easy, and the lens is held securely in place without uneven pressures that can bend it and distort your vision.

The lightweight yet durable frame is made of O Matter. This is shaped with surge ports to maintain a cooling flow of air. Interchangeable nose pads let you achieve a comfortable, customizable fit, and the earsocks are made of the same sport-optimized Unobtainium to increase grip when you sweat. Uneven pressure points are eliminated because its Three-Point Fit holds the frame comfortably in place while keeping the lens in precise optical alignment, rather than hooking over your ears.

Radarlock comes in an Oakley Soft Vault case that lets you store an extra lens, and each frame comes with two lenses: one for bright days and one for low-light conditions.

Features in brief:

Oakley Switchlock interchangeable lens technology for fast and easy lens changing
Durability and all-day comfort of lightweight, stress-resistant O Matter frame material
Integrated surge ports to channel airflow for the comfort of cooling
Unobtainium earsocks that increase grip when you sweat
Comfort and performance of Three-Point Fit that holds the lens in precise optical alignment
Multiple interchangeable Unobtainium nose pad options for secure, customizable fit that maximizes comfort
Metal icon accents

							With free £20 Birdseye Select Mapping Voucher - The BirdsEye™ select voucher allows Garmin users to choose customized sections of raster-based maps for compatible handheld devices, download them straight from Garmin's website and integrate them with existing maps.

Garmin’s BirdsEye Select database contains high-resolution Ordnance Survey images for a true representation of your surroundings. BirdsEye Select works with your Garmin handheld maps to add real-world detail to roads, buildings and the terrain for a greater appreciation of your environment.

eTrex 30 takes one of the most popular and reliable GPS handhelds and makes it better. Enhanced ergonomics, an improved interface, paperless geocaching and expanded mapping capabilities makes eTrex more versatile and user-friendly, while maintaining its toughness and durability.

See The Way
eTrex 30 has an enhanced 2.2 in 65K colour, brilliant, sunlight-readable display. Durable and waterproof, eTrex 30 is built to withstand the elements. It has an upgraded interface and stands strong against the elements - be it dust, dirt, humidity or water, none of which are a match for this versatile navigator.

The Right Tools for your Adventure
eTrex 30 adds a built-in 3-axis tilt-compensated electronic compass, which shows your heading even when you're standing still, without holding it level. Also added is a barometric altimeter which tracks changes in pressure to pinpoint your precise altitude, and you even can use it to plot barometric pressure over time, which can help you keep an eye on changing weather conditions.

Get the Mapping You Want
With its microSD card slot and 1.7 GB of internal memory, eTrex 30 lets you load our range of Ordnance Survey maps such as Garmin GB Discoverer and hit the trail, plug in BlueChart g2 preloaded cards for a great day on the water or City Navigator NT map data for turn-by-turn routing on roads (see maps tab for compatible maps). eTrex 30 also supports BirdsEye Select map download service that lets you download premium raster maps to your device and integrate them with your existing maps.

Find Fun
eTrex 30 supports geocaching GPX files for downloading geocaches and details straight to your unit. Visit OpenCaching.com to start your geocaching adventure. By going paperless, you're not only helping the environment but also improving efficiency. eTrex 30 stores and displays key information, including location, terrain, difficulty, hints and descriptions, which means no more manually entering coordinates and paper print outs. Simply upload the GPX file to your unit and start hunting for caches.

Share Wirelessly
eTrex 30 lets you share your waypoints, tracks, routes and geocaches wirelessly with other compatible Garmin GPS devices. So now your friends also can enjoy your favorite hike or cache - simply press send to transfer your information to similar units, and let the games begin.

Keep Your Fix
With its high-sensitivity, EGNOS-enabled GPS receiver and HotFix satellite prediction, eTrex locates your position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons.

Go Anywhere
With an array of compatible mounts, eTrex 20 can be used on your bicycle, boat, in your car or motorbike and off-road vehicle. You even get turn-by-turn directions with the auto mount and City Navigator NT maps. Wherever you think you might take eTrex, it has the mapping and mounts to get you there.

Go Global
The new eTrex series is the first-ever consumer-grade receivers that can track both GPS and GLONASS satellites simultaneously. GLONASS is a system developed by the Russian Federation that will be fully operational in 2012. When using GLONASS satellites, the time it takes for the receiver to lock on to a position is (on average) approximately 20 percent faster than using GPS. And when using both GPS and GLONASS, the receiver has the ability to lock on to 24 more satellites than using GPS alone.

							The Vaude Mark L 2 Person Tent is designed for when things need to go fast: lightweight 3-season tent for trekkers and backpackers that can be pitched in no time at all thanks to the tried-and-tested Mark wrap-around construction. Provides ample space and head room for 2 people. For optimal air circulation, you can rely on the window ventilation and weather-proof scoop vents at the entrance.

The Mark design, as the name says, is used with all Mark models. Quick setup, generous space and high wind stability make the design ideal for lots of action all over the mountain. Thanks to its elastic cording, the Mark design offers hardly any surface area for the wind to attack and is thus very stable. The elastic cording is wrapped around the self-supporting poles and means that setup is unbeatably fast. Even those less familiar with pitching tents can set up within three minutes. When setting up the poles, makes sure the connectors with the VAUDE logo are facing upwards.

Siliconized for longer lifespan - 3-ply silicone coating outside for excellent UV reflection. Superior water beading properties - water simply beads up. Re-tensioning - the nylon fabric stretches somewhat when wet. The tent should be re-tensioned if it begins to rain or snow.

							Similar to the Omega the Omega XL is a generously sized tunnel tent with a large inner space, large living space, and increased head room. The 450XL offers a four man bedroom at the back of the tent maximising space in the living area and the 600XL offers an additional two man bedroom at the front of the tent while still providing a comfortable living space.

Tension Band System ensures that your tent performs in adverse conditions, especially strong, changeable winds. In calm conditions the system can be disconnected if desired. When tensioned, the bands brace the pole and prevent sideways movement. The buckles should be adjusted so that slack is removed, but not over tensioned, as this may deform the poles.

Doors are constructed so that rain will not drop into the inner when opened, while twin flysheet doors gives you the option of having a porch for access and one for storage, or allows easier access for two or more occupants.

The constant curve of the inner doors enables the door to be opened in one movement, using one hand. The door has a mesh panel in the upper half for extra ventilation.

							The new rugged and waterproof GPS Oregon series, with more features, more power and the most brilliant, sunlight readable touchscreen of any Garmin handheld.

With high-sensitivity GPS and GLONASS satellite tracking (more satellites mean faster fixes, even in challenging environments), preloaded worldwide basemap with shaded relief and a faster processor, you can intuitively interact with maps. Zoom in, pan out and rotate using multi-touch in any conditions and even with most gloves. The reflective display technology boosts touchscreen brightness so much that maps and displays are as vivid in full bright sunlight as they are in shade.

Oregon 600 was purposely engineered for the outdoors, strengthened for impact resistance but with multi-touch and dual orientation views that still accommodate gloved operation. Bumps, dust, dirt, humidity and water are no match for this mapping-oriented navigator.

There is a built-in 3-axis electronic compass with accelerometer tilt compensation, which shows where you're heading even when standing still, and not holding it level. Its barometric altimeter tracks changes in pressure to pinpoint your precise altitude, and you even can use it to plot barometric pressure over time, which can help you keep an eye on changing weather conditions.

Besides its outstanding performance of up to 16 hrs of battery time the new Oregon 600 features our outdoor optimised dual battery system.

You can wirelessly transfer large files such as photos, geocaches, routes and Custom Maps between Oregon 600-series devices. Plus, new technology allows your routes, waypoints and tracks to transfer up to 50 times faster. Sync your data such as waypoints, geocaches, tracks and images to the Garmin Cloud, and access from anywhere via your smartphone and BaseCamp mobile app. Oregon is also ANT+ wireless compatible with heart rate, chirp and tempe sensors.

You can even display and enter coordinates in British Grid format, the grid used on Ordnance Survey maps, and you can add more maps and satellite images. No more picking, choosing and planning, just download them all. The Oregon 600 can hold a massive number of geocaches, four million in fact.

BaseCamp software is the perfect environment to comfortably prepare your trips with maps, waypoints, tracks and routes before you get out and once you are home again to create amazing trips to share with friends, family or fellow explorers. The software displays topographic map data in 2-D or 3-D on your computer screen, including contour lines and elevation profiles.

Garmin Adventures provides a free, interactive way to share your hikes, bike rides, road trips and more. Using BaseCamp, you can combine track logs, waypoints, geotagged photos, YouTube videos and more into an adventure that gets published online. You can then email a link to your adventure to friends and family, share it on social media sites or even post it in your favourite forums. BaseCamp even makes it easy to follow in the footsteps of other travellers by allowing you to search for and download adventures.
