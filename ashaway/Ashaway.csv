Product,,Bird 2,Ashaway,£29.99,£29.99,£29.99,"<div class=""article-content""><h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Introducing our new and innovative plastic shuttle, exclusive to Goode Sport worldwide. With 16 years of research and development behind it we believe this is the future of shuttlecocks.</p>
<p>Although still a plastic shuttle, the unique patented 2 piece design sets it apart from other nylon shuttles, just one of many features that leads to a far more feather like performance. As a result of it's unique design the Bird offers three times the rigidity of standard plastics meaning it won't collapse on impact and gives more feel on the racket face. You'll also notice a big difference in the sound made when hitting smashes and clears.</p>
<p>Another feather like feature of the Bird is the flight parabola (peak and drop). It has a far more stable flight with quicker righting. This translates to net shots too, where The Bird will perform a much slower and lower bounce than that of a standard plastic, making play more realistic to a feather.</p>
<p>Unlike a feather, The Bird's solid construction will keep it's speed consistent throughout it's life. This sturdiness is a result of the shuttle's turbine flutes being moulded rather than pressed. This added sturdiness results in a longer, more consistent shuttle life than a feather.</p>
<p>Although feather shuttles will always be most players preference, the ongoing problems with production costs and bird flu means badminton as a sport, needs to think of an alternative. <br>The Bird we believe, is it.</p>

<p>Distinctive new black string with white crosses adds flare and variety to fastest growing Ashaway string category</p>

<li> Diameter - 1.15 (18 guage)</li>
<li>Available in 110m Reel or 9m Set (1 re-string)</li>
<li>Colour - Black with white crosses</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashaway, RI – Ashaway Racket Strings has added new flare to its popular 18 gauge SuperNick<sup>®</sup> XL Micro squash string by introducing a new black and white pattern. The distinctive new design adds variety and choice to what has become Ashaway's fastest growing squash string category. Ashaway's other 1.15 mm squash strings include UltraNick<sup>®</sup> 18 and PowerNick<sup>®</sup> 18.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Known for its unique construction of nylon multifilament core and double-braided multifilament jacket, Ashaway SuperNick XL Micro has very high linear density, which results in superior durability for an 18 gauge string, while still providing optimum ball control and spin generation at lower tensions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Our bright yellow-colored string with the trademark red and blue SuperNick XL crossing pattern has been well regarded by top amateur players for its resiliency and ball control,"" said Steve Crandall, Vice President of Ashaway. ""The new black and white cross pattern SuperNick XL Micro is very flashy and distinctive. It will go very well with some of the new racquet graphics, and will be very recognizable as a member of the Ashaway SNXL family of squash strings.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SuperNick XL Micro utilizes a textured surface similar to Ashaway's standard 17 gauge SuperNick XL products. This textured surface allows for optimum shot making and excellent ball control. With the durability added by its higher linear density, SuperNick XL Micro squash string is recommended for all styles and levels of play, and for players looking for a soft feel, excellent playability and resiliency. Recommended stringing tension is up to 35 lbs.</p></div>",270,,,Squash String,Supernick XL Micro Black,,N,,Buy Supernick XL Micro Black Online in India at LiveYourSport.com| Free Shipping and Massive Discounts,Buy Supernick XL Micro Black Online in India at LiveYourSport.com| Free Shipping and Massive Discounts,Buy Supernick XL Micro Black Online in India at LiveYourSport.com| Free Shipping and Massive Discounts,Y,By Product,1,2,3,http://goode-sport.co.uk//data/img/products/gallery/627.jpg?542a77cd,http://goode-sport.co.uk//data/img/products/gallery/719.jpg?544e66eb,http://goode-sport.co.uk//data/img/products/gallery/720.jpg?544e671a

Product,,Ion Storm XT,Ashaway,£129.99,£129.99,£129.99,"<div class=""article-content""><h2>Overview </h2>
<p>The NEW Black Knight Storm XT uses Thin-K technology in a fast and powerful bridged frame.  It is also equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nano Crystalline Technology</strong> (NCT) which is an additive incorporated into the carbon fibre that not only helps reduce vibration but binds the fibres for added durability.</li>
<li><strong>BK’s Thermal Core technology</strong> (TC) in which the racquet is pressurized with superheated air while it is being cured in the ovens. This allows for a uniform curing process inside the frame and out for greater durability and a more responsive hit.</li>
<li><strong>16K</strong> fibres, the highest standard of graphite available -16,000 individual strands woven together for more structural strength.</li>
<li><strong>Power of 6</strong> - this frame is fine-tuned for optimum performance by first analyzing it under stress at 6 points, from the handle to the top of the head. The resulting data are then used to make further adjustments to the frame until the ideal specifications are achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>With a Dynamic Weight of 130 and a frame weight of 135g, the Black Knight Storm XT has a head light balance. Rated as stiff, it is strung with Ashaway PowerNick 19 string for better bite on the ball and less air resistance. RAD Mesh on the handle is ideal for a secure long lasting grip on this great racquet. </span></p>
