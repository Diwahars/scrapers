		Rs.1,050.00			",TRX™ Xtender," 

The TRX® Xtender is 37"" inches in length. For greater lengths simply join two or more Xtenders together. We recommend using one TRX Xtender for anchor points under 25 inches in circumference. And two or more combined Extenders for larger anchor points.
To attach the Xtender follow these steps:

Slide the Suspension Anchor with carabiner end first through the Xtender's small loop.
Wrap the Xtender around the anchor point until the entire length of the Xtender is deployed.
The Xtender should wrap around the anchor point at least 1.5 times. (use more Extenders if necessary)
Slide the carabiner through the end of the Xtender's big loop then clip the carabiner around the yellow Suspension Anchor strap.
Pull hard on the Suspension Anchor. It will pull the loops of the Xtender together locking the Xtender around the anchor point.
To adjust anchor height release tension on the Suspension Anchor and move the Anchor/Xtender assembly up or down then repeat step ""5"" to re-lock the assembly.

Complete set up and use instructions are included in the box. The TRX Xtender is compatible with all TRX® Anchoring Solutions including TRX®Xmount (sold separately).

		Rs.10,050.00			",Performance Golf Kit," Our Performance Golf kit is the ultimate package to massage and maintain the eight areas of the body that have the greatest impact on a golfer's swing. This kit is what we recommend for anyone having aches and pains in areas such as but not limited to the: Soleus Gastrocnemius Quadriceps Psoas Piriformis Lats Pecs and Thoracic Spine.

The Performance Golf Kit consists of all the tools you need to conduct the massage manipulations that we outline on the TP Golf Guidebook. The instructional Golf Guidebook is included in the kit to show exactly how to use our tools effectively and efficiently. The Hip and Lower Back Instructional and Biomechanical DVDs can be purchased separately. You can’t forget that every bone has a muscle that surrounds it and every joint has a muscle and a tendon that supports it. So when it comes to massage don’t you think it’s time you do it everyday?
Day-to-day activity can take its toll on the body. Whether it's training for a triathlon marathon sporting event or just general work activities your body and its biomechanics are continuously being compromised. The way you sit stand run and drive affects the way your body will function.
When the soleus and calves tighten they reduce dorsal flexion of the foot forcing your quads to take the absorption of each step when you run or walk. As your quads become overworked and tight your TFL and psoas also become overworked as well. Your psoas connects the front of your body to the back of your body when it gets tight it compresses the lower back. This can cause your pelvis to tilt resulting in IT band problems lower-back pain and muscular challenges in other areas.

Massage has been found to be a great way to counteract the effects of poor biomechanics. Myofascial release refers to the manual massage technique for stretching the fascia and releasing bonds between fascia integument and muscles with the goal of eliminating pain increasing range of motion and equilibrioception. Myofascial release usually involves applying shear compression or tension in various directions or by skin rolling.
 
Golf Guidebook
The instructional Golf Guidebook included in this kit contains a detailed breakdown of the biomechanical chain reaction that occurs when a golfer swings his club. It goes even further to show how to manipulate each of the eight critical areas using our Trigger Point massage tools.

 

TP 2-ball
Our TP 2-Ball is meant to contain two of our massage balls which expands the number of manipulations that are possible with our tools. This also allows us to offer alternative manipulations in our Golf Guidebook. The TP 2-Ball is included in our new Performance Golf Kit.
Trigger Point Performance products are specifically designed to support the massage associated with Trigger Point Therapy Myofascial Release Therapy and other forms of massage therapy.
*Every Performance Golf Kit includes a Golf Guidebook and a TP 2-ball!

The DVD will talk about what the body goes through on a daily basis and how it affects biomechanics. You will also find tips for success within this DVD to give you pointers on hydration icing stretching and other things we do or need to worry about daily. A sample of the education we cover in the DVD is below.
Day-to-day activity can take its toll on the body. Whether it's training for a triathlon marathon sporting event or just general work activities your body and its biomechanics are continuously being compromised. The way you sit stand run and drive affects the way your body will function.
When the soleus and calves tighten they reduce dorsal flexion of the foot forcing your quads to take the absorption of each step when you run or walk. As your quads become overworked and tight your TFL and psoas also become overworked as well. Your psoas connects the front of your body to the back of your body when it gets tight it compresses the lower back. This can cause your pelvis to tilt resulting in IT band problems lower-back pain and muscular challenges in other areas.
Massage has been found to be a great way to counteract the effects of poor biomechanics. Myofascial release refers to the manual massage technique for stretching the fascia and releasing bonds between fascia integument and muscles with the goal of eliminating pain increasing range of motion and equilibrioception. Myofascial release usually involves applying shear compression or tension in various directions or by skin rolling.
Trigger Point Performance products are specifically designed to support the massage associated with Trigger Point Therapy Myofascial Release Therapy and other forms
