With its OptiFit design, the X Hot Driver also provides enhanced adjustability for a wide range of swings. A lighter configuration, optimized CG and larger sweet spot help to maximize length, and the OptiFit Hosel lets golfers set the speed frame face to fine tune their trajectory off the tee.</p><p> OptiFit Technology: OptiFit Hosel allows golfers to set the adjustable speed frame face in either the Open, Square or Closed positions to fine tune trajectory and appearance. </p><p>Speed Frame Face Technology: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a larger sweet spot and fast ball speed for maximum distance. This technology also saves weight that can be redistributed to the perimeter of the clubhead for a higher MOI. </p><p>Ultra Thin Wall Casting Technology: Callaway's thinnest casting technology ever creates a lighter overall configuration and an optimized CG to promote more distance.</p>
<p>Lightweight Project X Velocity Shaft: This premium lightweight shaft further enhances speed and distance.</p>
<br><b>FAIRWAY:</b><br><p>Callaway X Hot Fairway Woods are longer from everywhere and offer total performance combining a Forged Face Cup with the Speed Frame Face to increase ball speeds across the face. Designed with a lower CG to reduce spin and a modern Warbird soleplate, these new fairway woods provide increased distance and versatility from the tee, fairway or rough.</p><p>Forged Speed Frame Face Cup: Increases ball speeds across the face for longer, more consistent distance from everywhere.</p><p>Modern Warbird Sole: This updated design builds off of one of the most versatile fairway woods ever produced to provide increased versatility from everywhere.</p>

</p>

<br><b>HYBRID:</b><br> <p>The <b>Hyper Distances with Hyper-speed Technology</b></p><p> The new X2 Hot hybrid by Callaway Golf is re-engineered with all new driver face technology for distance and a tour inspired shape for accuracy. Callaway has taken the same quantum leap in technology and performance in their fairway category to produce the new X2 Hot hybrid sure to be a major contender on course and in your arsenal of hitters.</p><br><p><b>Features &amp; Benefits</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Same Hyper Speed Face Cup as in the X2 Hot Fairway Wood and Driver, made of 455 Carpenter Steel; It's thinner, lighter and more robust to provide exceptional ball speed and unmatched distance.</li>
<li>
First time we've used face cup technology in a hybrid, which leads to driver-like CT performance-the CT in this hybrid is 240-245; a huge leap!
</li>
<li>
Bigger gains on off-centre hits (even low on the face).
</li>
<li>Redesigned, tour-inspired head shape so they look like true hybrids - we, Callaway, came up with our own shape!
</li>
<li>
20% increase in CT on centre hits.
</li>
<li>
30-40% increase in CT on off-centre hits.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>IRONS:</b><br> <p>The Callaway X Hot Iron's renowned accuracy is just the beginning with an undercut cavity and Speed Frame Face Technology that make this Callaway's longest iron ever. The low, deep center of gravity creates long distance without sacrificing trajectory or stopping power while new feel management technology promotes crisp, dynamic feel at higher ball speeds.</p>

<p>Crafted by Callaway Chief Designer Roger Cleveland with direct input from Callaway's players, these irons provide the ultimate in feel and performance that you can only get in a pure Forging. The Triple Net Forging process allows for more aggressive grooves and extreme precision to create the feel, ball flight and turf interaction that the very best players prefer.</p>

<p>

Speed Frame Face Technology: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a larger sweet spot and increases ball speeds across the face for longer, more consistent distance. This technology is borrowed from the X Hot Driver and has been applied to the irons.</p>

<p>
Deep Undercut Cavity Design: The deep clubface/undercut cavity system enables engineers to precisely position the CG, increase face compliance and engineer the face of each individual iron to maximize ball speed.

</p>

<p>

Feel Management Technology is produced through a dual material medallion that fine-tunes sound and promotes a crisp, dynamic feel at higher ball speeds.

"<div class=""grid_18 description left alpha omega""><h3>Product Description</h3><b>DRIVER:</b><br><p>Outrageous Ball Speed. Explosive Distance. That's what you'll get with the Callaway X Hot Driver. With its OptiFit design, the X Hot Driver also provides enhanced adjustability for a wide range of swings. A lighter configuration, optimized CG and larger sweet spot help to maximize length, and the OptiFit Hosel lets golfers set the speed frame face to fine tune their trajectory off the tee.</p><p> OptiFit Technology: OptiFit Hosel allows golfers to set the adjustable speed frame face in either the Open, Square or Closed positions to fine tune trajectory and appearance. </p><p>Speed Frame Face Technology: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a larger sweet spot and fast ball speed for maximum distance. This technology also saves weight that can be redistributed to the perimeter of the clubhead for a higher MOI. </p><p>Ultra Thin Wall Casting Technology: Callaway's thinnest casting technology ever creates a lighter overall configuration and an optimized CG to promote more distance.</p>
<p>Lightweight Project X Velocity Shaft: This premium lightweight shaft further enhances speed and distance.</p>
<br><b>FAIRWAY:</b><br><p>Callaway X Hot Fairway Woods are longer from everywhere and offer total performance combining a Forged Face Cup with the Speed Frame Face to increase ball speeds across the face. Designed with a lower CG to reduce spin and a modern Warbird soleplate, these new fairway woods provide increased distance and versatility from the tee, fairway or rough.</p><p>Forged Speed Frame Face Cup: Increases ball speeds across the face for longer, more consistent distance from everywhere.</p><p>Modern Warbird Sole: This updated design builds off of one of the most versatile fairway woods ever produced to provide increased versatility from everywhere.</p>

<br><b>HYBRID:</b><br> <p>The <b>Hyper Distances with Hyper-speed Technology</b></p><p> The new X2 Hot hybrid by Callaway Golf is re-engineered with all new driver face technology for distance and a tour inspired shape for accuracy. Callaway has taken the same quantum leap in technology and performance in their fairway category to produce the new X2 Hot hybrid sure to be a major contender on course and in your arsenal of hitters.</p><br><p><b>Features &amp; Benefits</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Same Hyper Speed Face Cup as in the X2 Hot Fairway Wood and Driver, made of 455 Carpenter Steel; It's thinner, lighter and more robust to provide exceptional ball speed and unmatched distance.</li>
<li>
First time we've used face cup technology in a hybrid, which leads to driver-like CT performance-the CT in this hybrid is 240-245; a huge leap!
</li>
<li>
Bigger gains on off-centre hits (even low on the face).
</li>
<li>Redesigned, tour-inspired head shape so they look like true hybrids - we, Callaway, came up with our own shape!
</li>
<li>
20% increase in CT on centre hits.
</li>
<li>
30-40% increase in CT on off-centre hits.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>IRONS:</b><br> <p>The Callaway X Hot Iron's renowned accuracy is just the beginning with an undercut cavity and Speed Frame Face Technology that make this Callaway's longest iron ever. The low, deep center of gravity creates long distance without sacrificing trajectory or stopping power while new feel management technology promotes crisp, dynamic feel at higher ball speeds.</p>

<p>Crafted by Callaway Chief Designer Roger Cleveland with direct input from Callaway's players, these irons provide the ultimate in feel and performance that you can only get in a pure Forging. The Triple Net Forging process allows for more aggressive grooves and extreme precision to create the feel, ball flight and turf interaction that the very best players prefer.</p>

<p>

Speed Frame Face Technology: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a larger sweet spot and increases ball speeds across the face for longer, more consistent distance. This technology is borrowed from the X Hot Driver and has been applied to the irons.</p>

<p>
Deep Undercut Cavity Design: The deep clubface/undercut cavity system enables engineers to precisely position the CG, increase face compliance and engineer the face of each individual iron to maximize ball speed.

</p>

<p>

Feel Management Technology is produced through a dual material medallion that fine-tunes sound and promotes a crisp, dynamic feel at higher ball speeds.
