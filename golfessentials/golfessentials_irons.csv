"SpeedBlade irons take the Speed Pocket to the next level, giving golfers an instrument that will change the nature of their approach shots to help them hit more greens and shoot lower scores. SpeedBlade is radically differently than any other iron in terms of look, speed, launch, spin, feel, sound.Visually, SpeedBlade irons are striking, combining a two-tone, satin nickel chrome plating with dark smoke satin ion plating (IP). Internally, the key performance feature that separates SpeedBlade from the pack is the Speed Pocket, a handle-bar shaped slot in the sole of the 3-7 irons that enables a large area of the face to flex and rebound at impact, resulting in faster ball speed, higher launch and better feel.The Speed Pocket performs where golfers need it most. Our research indicates that 72% of shots by 5 to 25 handicappers are impacted below the center of the face, which typically results in low-launching shots of inconsistent distance. The Speed Pocket helps you launch those low-impact shots on a consistently higher, longer carrying and softer-landing flight.
The improved Speed Pocket has been widened and lengthened, giving golfers more face area toward the toe and heel that promotes a high launch angle, strong ball flight and a steep, quick stopping descent angle. The Speed Pocket also features a cut through slot internally, which allows for more flex and rebound on the bottom part of the face, making the SpeedBlade iron set the fastest face TaylorMade has ever created, measuring right up to USGA COR limit. 
Critical to the performance and visual appeal of SpeedBlade irons is their progressive shaping throughout the set. The slender topline and sole in the short irons promote better workability, feel and control. The long irons feature a bigger topline to inspire confidence at address, and have each been optimized to promote phenomenal distance as well as fantastic feel and sound, thanks to the vibration-dampening qualities of the Speed Pocket polymer and multi-material badge. 
TaylorMade engineers carefully managed the distance-gaps between each SpeedBlade iron by meticulously controlling loft, face thickness, CG location, shaft characteristics, club-length and, most importantly, the behavior of the Speed Pocket. The result is a complete iron set that delivers balanced and consistent gaps between every club. And as drivers, fairway woods and Rescue clubs have evolved to deliver more and more distance, TaylorMade engineers designed SpeedBlade to close the gap between the longest iron and the shortest metalwood in your bag.New elongated Speed PocketBenefit: Faster face and more ball speed in the center, down low, toward the toe and toward the heelLowest CG of any TaylorMade distance ironBenefit: Easy to launch on a high and strong flightIndividually engineered headsBenefit: Optimized distance, trajectory, control, spin, feel and soundAdvanced head structure, Speed Pocket polymer and multi-material badgeBenefit: Absorbs unwanted vibration to promote fantastic sound and feelBalanced distance gaps between each ironBenefit: Every iron is valuable; closes gap between longest iron and lowest metalwoodNote: The images shown above are indicative only, actual product may differ according to the selection of specifications.","Regular Price: , 55,990","47,500",Right Handed Regular ; Left Handed Regular ;,,TaylorMade Speed Blade Irons (4-S) Steel Shaft,"http://golfessentials.in/images/taylormade/irons/speed_blade/1_thumb.jpg,http://golfessentials.in/images/taylormade/irons/speed_blade/2_thumb.jpg,http://golfessentials.in/images/taylormade/irons/speed_blade/3_thumb.jpg"

"Fantastic Callaway Consistency

It's not easy to create an iron set that's easy to hit yet provides power and feel for golfers who don't make a consistent swing. But Callaway and their design team have done exactly that with their new X2 Hot irons 40 percent more consistent than last season's X Hot irons.

Features &amp; Benefits


Visible Deep Undercut Channel increases the rate that the face flexes and rebounds. More ball speed than X Hot. All the features add up to this iron being 5 yards longer.
Hottest spots are low on the face, where most high handicap players make contact.
The stabilising arch stiffens the upper part of the face for more distance. This also helps to optimise the sound and feel due to the ultra-thin face.
Perimeter Weighting increases the sweet spot, making these easier to hit and more forgiving. Perimeter weighting also produces higher launch angles for more distance and stopping power on the greens.

"Shot-making Pure Precision - Exemplified

The latest quality forging from Mizuno and their golf engineers is the highly-anticipated MP-4. The new MP-4 is simply stunning with its classic shape and understated graphics that traditionalists will find elegantly flash-free. And, according to Chuck Couch, vice president of golf product for Mizuno, these new Mizuno irons feel as good if not better than any iron Mizuno has ever produced.

The Mizuno MP-4 is the purest of forged muscle backs, with a noticeably smaller face at ball address, and is for shot-makers seeking the ultimate control over their ball flight. On most irons the blade length of the iron gets longer as the club gets shorter. The MP-4 bucks that and instead of increasing blade length, Mizuno engineers added weight to the MP-4 irons by increasing the size of the muscle pad behind the sweetspot of the irons, which is the reason for the irons' pronounced bulge, or ""Pure Muscle"" in the back. The muscle bulge is most prominent (go ahead, stare, it's okay) in the scoring irons and reduces down through to the slender long irons - where design emphasis is placed on creating a quick launch and steeper landing angle. According to Mizuno and their design staff, the added mass amplifies the MP-4's ""Harmonic Number"" which are the frequencies created at impact that golfers equate with feel. That added mass gives these irons a pleasing ""sticky, soft feel"" at impact that provide a feel and sound about which golfers will rave.

These irons are not for everybody though due to their CAD designed final profile and exacting nature. But, ""the Mizuno MP-4 gives real shot-makers the ultimate control over their ball flight - with the very purest feel and feedback possible. If you want to learn to become a truly great shotmaker, the MP-4 is the best teacher you can have"" states Tetsuya Kanayama, Mizuno's Manager in club development.

Features 

Pure muscle design that ensures thickness behind impact for solid feel
Shot-maker's profile with thin topline and reduced offset to help manipulate ball flight
Variable muscle bulge with more bulge in the short irons for trajectory control
New profile 8-PW more compact than previous MP irons
Grain Flow Forged from a single 1025E pure select mild carbon steel billet for enhanced feel
Double nickel mirror chrome and plated with durable finish with soft underlay

"Traditionally Built, Aggressively Played

The latest release by Mizuno and their precision golf engineering masters is the wonderfully awaited MP-54 featuring a players-iron style size and shape. With the MP-54's milled pocket cavity, Mizuno was able to reposition an average of 16 grams to the blade's center section in an effort to give the new ""Step Muscle"" MP-54 iron the feel of a traditional iron.

That thickness behind the blade at impact, along with the step-muscle design (slightly larger than the MP-64) and combined with super-sweet forged from top-shelf carbon steel, gives the Mizuno MP-54 awesomely incredible feedback, feel, and improved launch angles - yet still maintains a certain level of forgiveness. But, it should be noted that level of forgiveness is for golfers, per Mizuno, who typically play in the zero to twelve handicap range. The Mizuno MP-54 is designed for shotmakers who have grown up on forgiving golf equipment and as such is crafted to awaken the shotmaker in players needing just a little forgiveness.

The Mizuno MP-54 irons keep with the gorgeous sparkle and shine tradition of beautifully made and spectacularly played golf clubs and with these irons you can expect nothing less.

Features 

Step Muscle design for additional thickness behind impact
Grain Flow Forged from a single 1025E Pure Select mild carbon steel billet for pure feel
Milled pocket cavity (3-7) for off-center stability, higher launches and steeper landing angles
Solid muscle design (8-PW) for enhanced feel and maneuverability

" The Callaway RAZR X HL Iron Set takes accuracy, distance and foregiveness to new highs. Each iron in this set has a low center of gravity so golfers can launch shots higher, even on impacts low on the face, so golf balls fly consistently farther and land softer on the greens. This low center of gravity makes the sweet spot more accessible at lower impact locations, where many amateurs strike the ball, meaning more accuracy and consistent distance. A Solid Impact Sole creates smooth turf interaction for better distance, accuracy and consistency and the VFT Power System, which is a fully integrated clubface/undercut cavity system, enables engineers to precisely position the center of gravity and engineer the face of each iron to maximize ball speed. This iron set is constructed of aluminum and thermoplastic polyurethane, meaning it fine-tunes sound and enhances feel off the clubface.

It's the ideal choice for golfers seeking greater distance and accuracy along with super soft feel and impressive styling. Featuring Zero Roll designing, the RAZR XF iron's clubface produces a higher launch angle on shots hit low on the face, thus increasing distance with softer landings. Constructed of aluminum and injection-molded plastic, the Multi-Material Medallion fine-tunes sound and enhances feel off the clubface. Precision shaping of the face thickness in each club increases the size of the sweet spot, generating higher ball speeds for longer distances. The hybrid club's inertia-driven design sports an increased head size and added offset to provide for Callaway's most forgiving hybrid, producing shots that fly higher, longer, and straighter. The black PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) finish comes from a high-tech process that produces a distinctive stealth look for reduced glare and a jewelry-like appearance.

"Fantastic Callaway Consistency

It's not easy to create an iron set that's easy to hit yet provides power and feel for golfers who don't make a consistent swing. But Callaway and their design team have done exactly that with their new X2 Hot irons 40 percent more consistent than last season's X Hot irons.

Features &amp; Benefits


Visible Deep Undercut Channel increases the rate that the face flexes and rebounds. More ball speed than X Hot. All the features add up to this iron being 5 yards longer.
Hottest spots are low on the face, where most high handicap players make contact.
The stabilising arch stiffens the upper part of the face for more distance. This also helps to optimise the sound and feel due to the ultra-thin face.
Perimeter Weighting increases the sweet spot, making these easier to hit and more forgiving. Perimeter weighting also produces higher launch angles for more distance and stopping power on the greens.
