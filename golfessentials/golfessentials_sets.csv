The low, deep center of gravity creates long distance without sacrificing trajectory or stopping power while new feel management technology promotes crisp, dynamic feel at higher ball speeds.

Crafted by Callaway Chief Designer Roger Cleveland with direct input from Callaway's players, these irons provide the ultimate in feel and performance that you can only get in a pure Forging. The Triple Net Forging process allows for more aggressive grooves and extreme precision to create the feel, ball flight and turf interaction that the very best players prefer.



Speed Frame Face Technology: A combination of VFT and Hyperbolic Face Technology creates a larger sweet spot and increases ball speeds across the face for longer, more consistent distance. This technology is borrowed from the X Hot Driver and has been applied to the irons.
