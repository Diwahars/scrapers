 A Perfect Blend of Friction and Feel…it’s how we roll.  New Metal-X Putters represent the latest chapter in Odyssey’s long history of game-changing innovations. The Metal-X Insert provides the crisp feedback of a metal striking force  coupled with amazing feel. The unique face pattern generates the truest roll in golf and the ovals on the face develop a mechanical lock with the golf ball’s dimples at impact  creating friction and imparting an incredibly consistent roll for high precision distance control. Metal-X Insert Dual layered insert designed to put a consistent  true roll on the ball with amazing feedback and feel. The 6061 aluminum striking layer’s oval depressions maximize the mechanical lock with the golf ball dimples to increase friction and impart proper launch of the golf ball  which in turn creates a much more controlled and consistent roll. The Urethane inner layer provides soft touch and saves weight to optimize performance.Midnight Black Finish Premium  high tech process produces a durable  glare reduction finish. This finish was added specifically based on feedback gathered from Tour players.Lamkin 3Gen Pistol Grip Thin  smaller pistol shape appeals to better players. The grip is made of Lamkin’s proprietary 3GEN material  which is their softest synthetic rubber compound and reduces vibration without dulling the feel of the putt. This allows golfers to keep their forearms relaxed  apply very light grip pressure and minimize hard tension for smooth  consistent strokes.Note: The golfessentials.in/images shown above are indicative only  actual product may differ according to the selection of specifications.ReviewsThere are no reviews for this product. ,,9490,Right Handed 3 34 ; Left Handed 3 34 ;,,Odyssey Metal X #9 Putter,golfessentials.in/images/odyssey/putters/metalx_9/1.jpg,golfessentials.in/images/odyssey/putters/metalx_9/2.jpg,golfessentials.in/images/odyssey/putters/metalx_9/3.jpg
