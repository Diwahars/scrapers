" The Callaway CG Forged Dark Chrome CC Wedge s the newest forged creation from Callaway Chief Designer Roger Cleveland. These wedges offer golfers all the control, spin and feel they could ever want to attack the pin with new finish options that exude confidence with a striking look. 21 tightly spaced, conforming grooves with sharper edges (due to the superior Triple Net Forging process) provide ideal trajectory and distance control while maximum conforming groove capacity ensures moisture is swept away, meaning more edges come in contact with the ball to maximize friction and increase spin. The Tour-inspired shape has a very traditional styling with a higher toe and straighter leading edge for a square look at address while providing versatility for pinpoint shot-making by relieving the heel and reducing the width of the sole. This design enables golfers to lay the face open while effectively reducing the bounce angle, allowing for proper contact and maximum spin and control. Each wedge loft has been paired with the ideal bounce to provide optimal turf interaction and versatility for creative shot-making.
