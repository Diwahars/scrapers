"Callaway's Longest Fairway Wood Ever.

Callaway Golf's most recent engineering marching orders were to make a fairway wood that outperforms the best fairway wood ever created, which might seem impossible, but Callaway has done exactly that with the new X2 Hot Fairway Wood that is a technological marvel.

Features &amp; Benefits


The New Hyper Speed Face Cup has a thinner, more robust 455 Carpenter Steel face cup design . This delivers faster ball speeds all over the face for longer, more consistent distance and is designed for where most players hit the ball.
An improvement was made to the Internal Standing Wave. Weight was moved lower and forward to precisely position the center of gravity for more consistent launch and spin as hits move away from the centre.
Warbird sole design is super versatile. It's great from any lie (due to camber on the sole).
Available in 3, 5, 7, and 9-wood.
The Aldila Tour Blue Shaft is a true after-market shaft, which comes standard in the X2 Hot Fairway with the same playing characteristics as the X2 Hot Driver.

"The Cleveland Mashie Fairway Wood is a utility-inspired fairway wood engineered for distance and versatility. It is highlighted by enhanced Gliderail technology on the sole that measurably decreases turf drag for more lift and speed and impact, meaning more distance and accuracy from any lie, rough, sand, tee or fairway. The Mashie incorporates Ultralite Technology with a shaft and grip combination that reduces total club weight by over 20 grams. A Miyazaki C. Kua 59 aftermarket graphite shaft, engineered specifically for fairway woods by the worldwide leader in Ultralite Technology, maximizes swing speed while maintaining incredible accuracy. The throwback RetroRaw finish on the Mashie's crown is a rugged, bulletproof look that encourages players to be bold and have the confidence to hit any shot from any lie.

"Unmatched ball speeds + Explosive distances = Mizuno EZ Performance

The new Mizuno JPX-EZ Fairway Wood is destined to be by far the easiest to hit and most forgiving fairway wood on the market. This revolutionary Mizuno fairway wood, designed from the ground up with the latest Mizuno engineering technology, delivers explosive distance from a wide variety of lie conditions or off the tee with added forgiveness and control for any level player, not just the typical mid to high handicap Mizuno Golf JPX player.

The Mizuno JPZ-EZ Fairway Wood features an ultra thin maraged hot metal face possessing superior strength and toughness with a slightly oversized 17-4 stainless steel body. The rebound crown design has expanded the COR area substantially and subsequently has the JPX-EZ fairway wood delivering unmatched ball speeds and explosive distance across the entire face of the club. Internal weighting allows Mizuno's deepest center of gravity yet ensuring maximum forgiveness. And a face forward design increases launch in the strongest lofts.

Mizuno Golf and their tech staff designed the JPX-EZ fairway wood to have you attacking the course and playing the game long like never before. Get one in your game and you'll see they are right.

A low and deep center of gravity provides more power and a high launch-angle for more carry and distance. Behind the clubface, they’ve enhanced the coefficient of restitution with inverted cone technology adds some spring to the clubface to increase ball speeds at the moment of impact for even more distance.

"Callaway's Longest Fairway Wood Ever.

Callaway Golf's most recent engineering marching orders were to make a fairway wood that outperforms the best fairway wood ever created, which might seem impossible, but Callaway has done exactly that with the new X2 Hot Fairway Wood that is a technological marvel.

Features &amp; Benefits


The New Hyper Speed Face Cup has a thinner, more robust 455 Carpenter Steel face cup design . This delivers faster ball speeds all over the face for longer, more consistent distance and is designed for where most players hit the ball.
An improvement was made to the Internal Standing Wave. Weight was moved lower and forward to precisely position the center of gravity for more consistent launch and spin as hits move away from the centre.
Warbird sole design is super versatile. It's great from any lie (due to camber on the sole).
Available in 3, 5, 7, and 9-wood.
The Aldila Tour Blue Shaft is a true after-market shaft, which comes standard in the X2 Hot Fairway with the same playing characteristics as the X2 Hot Driver.
