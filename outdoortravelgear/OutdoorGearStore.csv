Product,,GERBER Myth Blood Tracker - Hunting,Gerber,"7,400","7,400","7,400","<div class=""product_content_left"">
                
                        <h3>GERBER Myth Blood Tracker - Hunting</h3>
                        <div style=""clear:both;"">
                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The perfect shot is hard to make, so the need to track your game once it’s been hit is a reality for most hunters. The telltale sign is blood on the ground but, given dawn or dusk lighting, tracking blood on the ground is easier said than done. That’s why Gerber worked with hunters and engineers to develop the Myth Blood Tracking Light. This small, powerful LED flashlight enhances the color red in low-light situations to simplify tracking your downed animal.<br>
<strong>Optimized Spectrum for Fresh Blood</strong><br>
Similar to the way a black or UVA light makes the color white pop, this light’s spectrum is optimized to make fresh blood pop like neon in an environment where there is little naturally occurring red color. The new LED color spectrum is an upgrade from the version used in the original Game Tracker. It’s optimized to highlight blood that’s up to an hour old, and offers enhanced visibility in a broader range of lighting conditions.<br>
<strong>Efficient Two-Button Operation</strong><br>
The light offers efficient two-button operation. A single tail button turns the light on, and it’s ready to track. A second, side-mounted button changes the spectrum cast to gray out the field and further enhance the contrast of the blood when you toggle back to primary mode, perfect to help you determine whether you’re still on the blood trail.<br>
<strong>Comfortable Rubber Housing</strong><br>
Gerber understands hunting gear is subject to harsh conditions and rough use. The blood tracking light’s rubber outer shell is as durable and lightweight as it is comfortable to handle. It’s big enough to provide solid grip and small enough to fit in a pant cargo pocket or jacket hand pocket.</p>

<strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
Premium Quality 100% cotton yarn is knitted to form the base of MOS-QUIT-O blanket. An Internationally tested and proven mosquito repellant formulation is applied on this base fabric through factory treatment. This scientific formulation seeps into the fabric and binds itself tightly to each fiber which gives Mos-Quit-O blanket a long lasting, odourless, harmless and effective repellency that meets WHO standards.<br>

                            <p>There is justice in the world of Gerber multi-tools. Because while the Compact Sport may be the smaller, less formidable version of our Multi-Plier 600 series, this Multi-Plier 400 series compensates by being our most popular tool.<br>
This is no small victory. After all, our ultra compact workhorse brings all the same functionality and rugged performance characteristics of its big brother. Thanks to its stainless steel hardware. And its Fiskars scissors, which have the wherewithal to cut through seat belts. And thanks, as well, to the patented design of its one-handed opening pliers.<br>
The Compact is unmatched for strength, durability and ease of use. Our patented Saf.T.Plus locking system is your assurance that this little guy more than holds its own in the name of user safety. That is to say, your safety.</p>

                            <p>Down behind enemy lines? Left to fend for yourself? These are the scenarios that inspired the LMF II. Former military man, Jeff Freeman led the charge to engineer this fearless new 10"" survival knife. And we field-tested with the troops. This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus, the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter. The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap, so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement, limits noise, works for parachuting, and attaches to a belt or MOLLE vest. The patented, integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field.</p>

Like profound versatility, for example. And failsafe performance. And a level of rock-solid design and construction that pleases the eye and satisfies the soul.<br>
It all begins with high quality stainless steel. Then we incorporated Gerber's patented one-handed opening pliers. Of the 6 models available, three feature the standard needlenose plier and the other three have our bluntnose configuration.<br>
You'd be hard pressed to find a more rugged or more fearless multi-tool out there. But go ahead and look around a bit. See what you think. Then cmon back to Gerber and pick the Multi-Plier 600 that truly suits your needs. We're building plenty.</p>

                            <p><strong>Advanced Focus System™:</strong> Traditionally, light-focusing systems have consisted of either a lens, or a reflector. The Advanced Focus System (AFS) is the patented combination of a reflector AND lens to create a light system that provides both a focused beam for long-distance and a homogenous spill-beam for up-close reading. AFS means whether you’re reading a map up close or focusing down the path to a landmark in the distance, your light will be easy on the eyes, clear and bright.<br>
<strong>Smart Light Technology (Basic):</strong> Smart Light Technology allows you to program your light functions to the task at hand. Three light functions (Power, Low Power, and Defense Strobe) are easily operated with full or half clicks, ensuring your focus will be on the job, not on your light.<br>

                            <p>Attach your Phone or GPS securely to your handlebars. Use it to take video, or to keep track of your mapping app.<br>
You can also attach it to the helm bar on a yacht, or to a windsurfing boom.</p>

                            <p>- No tools required - designed to be attached with your fingers only.<br>
- You'll be able to talk and hear without a problem, through the special plastic (TPU). And you can get great video with your front-facing camera.<br>
(Note: The bike mount attachment means that there is no room to fit a lens window on the back of this case, so you cannot use a rear-facing/iSight camera. Sorry!)<br>
- It'll protect your phone from mud and dirt as well as water.<br>
- Most phones will float in this case - but make sure you test yours in a basin before you launch it into the sea!<br>

                            <p>Whether you're trail-running, snowboarding or cycling keeping your iPod dry is a no-brainer with our new rainproof case. A simple rain-flap allows you to insert your headphones (or Aquapac's waterproof headphones!) and as long as the case is hanging from its lanyard, a carabiner or in an armband it's weatherproof.</p>

- Guaranteed waterproof to IPX3 (hard rain) when upright.<br>
- Available in a choice of Hot Orange or Cool Grey.<br>
<strong>What does 'StormproofTM' Mean?</strong><br>
The roll-seal system used on this Aquapac has been used successfully on drybags for years. With a very simple 3 or 4 folds of the opening and then clipping 2 buckles in place, you can guarantee that the hardest rain or spray will be kept off your expensive gear. Whilst we don't recommend that you submerge our Stormproof pouches, they should also protect against accidental dropping into puddles if they're retrieved quickly.<br>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The protectors are made of Viscoelastic foam with memory effect and outstanding shock absorption values. After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly. The air which is embedded in the foam´s cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.<br>
We recommend this protector in textile jacket shoulders.</p>

                            <p>- Protectors surpass the required values of EN 1621-1:2012, level 2<br>
- Protectors are not destroyed by an impact and can still be used<br>
- Protectors are lightweight<br>
- Protectors are washable (remove, hand launder separately / water absorption less than one per cent)<br>
- Protectors can be used between the temperature range of -20*c to +100*C.<br>
- At high temperature, protector becomes softer and at freezing temperature, it becomes harder<br>
- Optimal for breathable textile clothing due to the ventilation openings.<br>
- High-end engineering for greater safety.<br>
- Protectors are symmetrical<br>
- Protectors are sold as a pair</p>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The protectors are made of Viscoelastic foam with memory effect and outstanding shock absorption values. After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly. The air which is embedded in the foam´s cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.<br>
We recommend these protectors for use in elbow and knee areas.  Also certified for use in the shoulder area.</p>

- Optimal for breathable textile clothing due to the ventilation openings.<br>

It is made by weaving 2-ply cotton yarn into a strong canvas fabric, which is then treated with a proprietary mixture of micro and technical waxes. This wax treatment creates a high water resistant barrier, while maintaining the breathability of the cotton. There is ample mesh around the stomach, under arms and back to let the air pass through for ventilation.<br>

                            <p><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>MOTOTECH Contour Air Riding Jacket Material:</strong> Waxed Cotton - Breathable, Burn Resistance and Abrasion Resistance material.<br>
<strong>Advantages of Waxed Cotton:</strong><br>
- It is somewhat burn-resistant, albeit still certainly flammable. If you’re sleeping by a campfire or welding in the shop, a few small sparks or hot ashes won’t ruin the fabric, unlike nylon or other synthetics that end up with tiny pinholes everywhere in the same situation.<br>
- It lasts much longer when exposed to the elements than most petroleum based fabrics. UV exposure will degrade most synthetic fabrics much faster than Waxed Cotton fabrics.<br>
- It is softer than most synthetic fabrics like nylon or polyester, making Waxed Cotton significantly less abrasive to auto and moto paint finishes.<br>
- It is also more gentle on bare skin. You usually don't buff your car or wipe yourself dry with a synthetic fabric - you use cotton!<br>
<strong>Sas Tec Protectors:</strong> The protectors are made of Viscoelastic foam with memory effect and outstanding shock absorption values. After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly. The air which is embedded in the foam´s cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.<br>
<strong>To Know More about Sas-Tec..</strong><br>
- Optimal for breathable textile clothing due to the ventilation openings.<br>
- Protectors are lightweight and are not destroyed on impact and can still be used.<br>
- Protectors are washable (remove, hand launder separately / water absorption less than one per cent)<br>
- Protectors can be used between the temperature range of -20*c to +100*C.<br>
<strong>Protection level:</strong> Protectors surpass the required values of EN 1621-1:2012 (mean value below 20 kN)<br>
<strong>Elbow Protector's Weight:</strong> ca. 72 g / item<br>
<strong>Elbow Protector's Dimensions (L/W/H):</strong>  ca. 250/160/11 mm<br>
<strong>Shoulder Protector's Weight:</strong> ca. 55 g / item<br>
<strong>Shoulder Protector's Dimensions (L/W/H):</strong> ca. 200/160/11 mm<br>

<strong>WAX COTTON CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
The proper care and treatment of your waxed cotton garment will ensure its longevity. When you are not wearing your garment, always be sure to hang it in a well-ventilated area. Dried mud, sand, grit and dirt should be removed as soon as possible, as it will have an abrasive effect on the waxed cotton.<br>
Variations in texture and shade are intrinsic qualities of such materials and should not be regarded as defects.<br>
CLASSIC AND LIGHTWEIGHT WAX COTTON<br>
<strong>Cleaning:</strong><br>
Regular cleaning not only enhances the appearance of your garment but removes dust and dirt that can cause premature wear. Regular cleaning also prevents dirt build-up from becoming irremovable stains.<br>
- REMOVE dried mud, sand and grit as soon as possible especially along inner sleeve seams, as these is abrasive.<br>
- HOSE OFF or SPONGE WIPE with cold water only. If dirt is ground in, gently brush it off with a soft bristled brush and then rinse.<br>
- HANG TO DRY naturally and completely for at least 24 hours in a dry, well-ventilated area.<br>
DO NOT dry clean • DO NOT machine wash • DO NOT tumble dry (no dryer) • DO NOT use soap or detergent of any kind • DO NOT use solvents or bleach • DO NOT iron or starch • DO NOT force dry or expose to a direct flame • DO NOT expose to direct sunlight for a long period of time (such as rear car window).<br>
Doing any of these will damage or remove the proofing and may void the garment’s warranty.<br>
<strong>Cleaning Steps:</strong><br>
1. Dip in Cold Water (Room Temperature Water).<br>
2. Rub the dirty area with soft fabric cleaning brush.<br>
3. Drip Dry.<br>
4. Your rejuvenated jacket is ready to use.<br>
<strong>How to Store Your Wax Cotton Garment:</strong><br>
To ensure the longevity or your wax cotton coat or jacket, be sure to only store clean, perfectly dried garments. Items stored not completely dried or stored in a humid area may very well develop mildew. Once stored, regularly inspect your garment for mildew or mildew-indicating smell to prevent damage from occurring to your garment. To store your coat or jacket hang it in a dry, cool and well-ventilated space, or fold and roll your garment for storage in a dry, cool and well-ventilated space.</span><br>

Made from Waxed cotton, a unique high-performance fabric probably second only to leather in the class of true outdoor fabrics in its ability to block the wind, it is a sustainable and an earth-friendly resource . It is made by weaving 2-ply cotton yarn into a strong canvas fabric, which is then treated with a proprietary mixture of micro and technical waxes. This wax treatment creates a high water resistant barrier, while maintaining the breathability of the cotton. There is ample mesh around the stomach, under arms and back to let the air pass through for ventilation.<br>

                            <p><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>MOTOTECH Contour Air Riding Jacket Material:</strong> Waxed Cotton - Breathable, Burn Resistance and Abrasion Resistance material.<br>
<strong>Advantages of Waxed Cotton:</strong><br>
- It is somewhat burn-resistant, albeit still certainly flammable. If you’re sleeping by a campfire or welding in the shop, a few small sparks or hot ashes won’t ruin the fabric, unlike nylon or other synthetics that end up with tiny pinholes everywhere in the same situation.<br>
- It lasts much longer when exposed to the elements than most petroleum based fabrics. UV exposure will degrade most synthetic fabrics much faster than Waxed Cotton fabrics.<br>
- It is softer than most synthetic fabrics like nylon or polyester, making Waxed Cotton significantly less abrasive to auto and moto paint finishes.<br>
- It is also more gentle on bare skin. You usually don't buff your car or wipe yourself dry with a synthetic fabric - you use cotton!<br>
<strong>Sas Tec Protectors:</strong> The protectors are made of Viscoelastic foam with memory effect and outstanding shock absorption values. After an impact or any kind of deformation the foam (protector) returns to its original shape within shortly. The air which is embedded in the foam´s cells provoke a progressive absorption. The protector remains soft in case of slowly increasing forces, however when it comes to a fast heavy impact the resistance of the foam grows with increasing speed.<br>
<strong>To Know More about Sas-Tec..</strong><br>
- Optimal for breathable textile clothing due to the ventilation openings.<br>
- Protectors are lightweight and are not destroyed on impact and can still be used.<br>
- Protectors are washable (remove, hand launder separately / water absorption less than one per cent)<br>
- Protectors can be used between the temperature range of -20*c to +100*C.<br>
<strong>Protection level:</strong> Protectors surpass the required values of EN 1621-1:2012 (mean value below 20 kN)<br>
<strong>Elbow Protector's Weight:</strong> ca. 72 g / item<br>
<strong>Elbow Protector's Dimensions (L/W/H):</strong>  ca. 250/160/11 mm<br>
<strong>Shoulder Protector's Weight:</strong> ca. 55 g / item<br>
<strong>Shoulder Protector's Dimensions (L/W/H):</strong> ca. 200/160/11 mm<br>

<strong>WAX COTTON CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
The proper care and treatment of your waxed cotton garment will ensure its longevity. When you are not wearing your garment, always be sure to hang it in a well-ventilated area. Dried mud, sand, grit and dirt should be removed as soon as possible, as it will have an abrasive effect on the waxed cotton.<br>
Variations in texture and shade are intrinsic qualities of such materials and should not be regarded as defects.<br>
CLASSIC AND LIGHTWEIGHT WAX COTTON<br>
<strong>Cleaning:</strong><br>
Regular cleaning not only enhances the appearance of your garment but removes dust and dirt that can cause premature wear. Regular cleaning also prevents dirt build-up from becoming irremovable stains.<br>
- REMOVE dried mud, sand and grit as soon as possible especially along inner sleeve seams, as these is abrasive.<br>
- HOSE OFF or SPONGE WIPE with cold water only. If dirt is ground in, gently brush it off with a soft bristled brush and then rinse.<br>
- HANG TO DRY naturally and completely for at least 24 hours in a dry, well-ventilated area.<br>
DO NOT dry clean • DO NOT machine wash • DO NOT tumble dry (no dryer) • DO NOT use soap or detergent of any kind • DO NOT use solvents or bleach • DO NOT iron or starch • DO NOT force dry or expose to a direct flame • DO NOT expose to direct sunlight for a long period of time (such as rear car window).<br>
Doing any of these will damage or remove the proofing and may void the garment’s warranty.<br>
<strong>Cleaning Steps:</strong><br>
1. Dip in Cold Water (Room Temperature Water).<br>
2. Rub the dirty area with soft fabric cleaning brush.<br>
3. Drip Dry.<br>
4. Your rejuvenated jacket is ready to use.<br>
<strong>How to Store Your Wax Cotton Garment:</strong><br>
To ensure the longevity or your wax cotton coat or jacket, be sure to only store clean, perfectly dried garments. Items stored not completely dried or stored in a humid area may very well develop mildew. Once stored, regularly inspect your garment for mildew or mildew-indicating smell to prevent damage from occurring to your garment. To store your coat or jacket hang it in a dry, cool and well-ventilated space, or fold and roll your garment for storage in a dry, cool and well-ventilated space.</span><br>

                            <p>There’s a reason this is one of our bestselling, longest-running packs: it’s got everything you need, and nothing you don’t. The M.U.L.E.® has a narrow-gauge design that keeps it light and maneuverable—so even when it’s fully loaded for a day of mountain biking, it won’t get in your way.<br>
Since we launched the first M.U.L.E. in 1996, mountain bikers have been telling us that it hits the sweet spot of size vs. storage: it’s lightweight, but big enough to carry three liters of water and a day’s worth of snacks and gear. Over the years, we’ve also added air channels to keep your back cool, plus clever compartments for stashing tools, keys and electronics.</p>

                            <p>There’s a reason this is one of our bestselling, longest-running packs: it’s got everything you need, and nothing you don’t. The M.U.L.E.® has a narrow-gauge design that keeps it light and maneuverable—so even when it’s fully loaded for a day of mountain biking, it won’t get in your way.<br>
Since we launched the first M.U.L.E. in 1996, mountain bikers have been telling us that it hits the sweet spot of size vs. storage: it’s lightweight, but big enough to carry three liters of water and a day’s worth of snacks and gear. Over the years, we’ve also added air channels to keep your back cool, plus clever compartments for stashing tools, keys and electronics.</p>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The screw is a glorious little invention, but damn if they don’t come loose (or worse, refuse to budge) from time to time—and always at the worst time. Gerber’s Daily Carry Zip Driver is a compact, simplified tool that attaches to a jacket or bag, so it’s there whenever you need to take on a stubborn screw. At home, use it to tighten a pair of glasses or an escaping frying pan handle. At work, stealthily fix that annoying bathroom door.<br>
<strong>Four Tools In One</strong><br>
This palm-sized driver’s rotating wheel holds the four most commonly used screwdriver heads—two flat and two Phillips. Snap one into place, and a ball detent mechanism locks it tight enough to take on the oldest, rustiest screw. The quick-release clip lets you quickly pop it on and off a zipper or a pack strap, and the compact size means even screws tucked out of sight and barely in reach are in the line of fire.</p>

                        <h3>GERBER GDC Zip Light+ - Essentials</h3>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>Long is the night, and longer still the walk back home when you’re caught out without the proper tools. The Gerber Daily Carry Zip Light keeps illumination near at hand, whether you’re close to home or miles from nowhere. Its compact size and reliable clip let you attach it to a zipper, pack or keychain, and then forget about it—until you really need a light.<br>
<strong>Light Bright</strong><br>
The beauty behind this compact tool is simple: A super bright beam that lives nearby, and can be used to light your way should darkness or other hurdles emerge. It’s equally at home handling life’s non-emergencies—use it to locate items swallowed by your backpack or shoulder bag, or to stealthily recover dropped possessions from underneath a theater seat.<br>
<strong>A Multi-purpose Tool</strong><br>
A quick-release clip lets you remove this light with one hand, so you can use your other one to search out whatever you’re looking for. The white LED puts off enough lumens to read by without waking a sleeping tentmate, or to navigate back to your car after the game. Time for a cold one? The integrated stainless steel opener’s got your back.</p>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>Hex head screws are everywhere, and especially on your gear: bikes, boards, skis and ATVs. In short, all the important stuff. Keep adjustability close at hand with one compact, solid hex tool. Gerber’s Daily Carry Zip Hex has better grip than your fingernails, more versatility than your keys and is stronger than both of them combined. Don’t let the lack of the right tool spoil a good day outdoors.<br>
<strong>Five Tools In One</strong><br>
The palm-sized hex’s rotating wheel holds the five most commonly used metric Allen wrenches. Stem bolts, binding attachments, furniture, exercise equipment—no matter what you’re working on, the Zip Hex can help.<br>
Choose a bit, snap it into place, and a ball detent mechanism locks it in place. The lightweight, grippy handle resists slippage, and the stainless steel bits will hold up to serious torque.<br>
<strong>Made To Be Mobile</strong><br>
The quick-release clip makes for easy removal from keychain or zipper, and the compact size means it won’t hog valuable space in your pocket or bike bag.</p>

                            <p><strong>Easy Mounting:</strong> Keep the Turtle on the tank, pull the flippers and make them hug the tank as tightly as possible for the best grip and you are ready to go. To Remove pull the Flippers sideways and you got it in your arms. Since the design is common for all bikes, the magnets inside the flippers are movable by a couple of inches radius. helping you find that sweet spot on your tank for optimum mounting.<br>
<strong>Fits:</strong><br>
- Royal Enfield (Any Model w/o Rubber Pads)<br>
- Bajaj Pulsar,Discover,Avenger.<br>
- Honda Unicorn<br>
- Hero Honda CBZ/Extreme<br>
- TVS Apache<br>
- Yamaha RX100/RD350, etc.<br>
<strong>Does Not work on:</strong> Non-Metallic Tanks like FZ - 16 | FAZER | KTM<br>
<strong>Does Not Fit:</strong> Hero Honda Hunk and other bikes with excess plastic fairing on the Tanks.<br>
<strong>Construction:</strong> Made of 600 Dernier Ribbed Polyester with Rubberized PVC Coating Plus Additional internal Nylon lining. Excellent Imported Industrial grade fabric, strong and being synthetic makes it more tolerant to variable weather conditions.<br>
<strong>Fitting/Compatibility:</strong> Effectiveness of the Magnetic Tankbag is not the same on all the bikes, albeit it sticks to all Tanks. So before you order please confirm its fitting by contacting us or by the simple DIY tests below to avoid any regrets later.<br>
<strong>To Gauge the effectiveness of the Turtle on your bike:</strong><br>
- Check the shape of your tank: Convex shape in the sides improves the grip of the Tankbag Along the running area (Tank height) should be at least 8 inches for the front Flippers and 6 inches in the rear to hug the Tank provide optimum grip.<br>
- Check for extra fittings on Tank sides: Some Motorcycles (especially Royal Enfield) have Rubber Pads on the tanks which come in the way of the flippers and affect the sticking power of the magnets.<br>

                            <p>When it comes to versatility and ease of carry, a full-size folding knife is both convenient and fully capable of undertaking field dressing and the diverse needs of a hunting trip. The Moment Large Sheath Folding Knife is a utilitarian tool for tasks big and small. From skinning to quartering, the 3.5-inch fine edge blade is designed for smooth engagement and firm cutting, while the molded rubber handle is designed for maximum comfort and a confident grip. Add the secure liner lock and you’ve got a seriously adept knife designed for in-pack or on-belt carry.<br>
<strong>Instantly Familiar in Hand</strong><br>
Working with feedback from hunters about grip preferences, Gerber designed the handle to be inviting and ergonomic. Combined with its textured rubber surface, the knife is instantly familiar in your hand, and affords confidence for pushing and pulling actions associated with field dressing game, not to mention general camp duties like prepping your tree stand or stringing up a tarp. Gerber’s decades of experience building knives comes through in details like a well-placed guard, thumb traction jimping on the spine and a generous choil.<br>
<strong>Everyday Carry Utility</strong><br>
A distinct advantage of this knife’s 3.5-inch drop point blade and folding design is its everyday utility. Firstly, it’s a capable hunting knife. But it’s a hunting knife that’s conveniently suited to everyday carry. The folding design is easily carried on a belt or a pack in its nylon sheath. From easy sharpening to carbon steel durability, the full-size blade is as practical as it is stout.</p>

                        <h3>GERBER Myth Fixed Blade Saw - Hunting</h3>
                        <div style=""clear:both;"">
                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>Cleaning and dressing large game is a serious project, and a portable fixed blade saw makes all the difference in getting the job done in a timely, effective fashion. Listening to veteran hunters, Gerber designed the Myth Fixed Blade Saw to meet the demands of cutting wood and bone. The combination of the saw’s fixed blade and T-handle give it a stout, confident feel for taking on both big game and diverse woodcutting needs.<br>
<strong>Carbon Steel Optimized for Bone and Wood</strong><br>
With decades of hunting experience, Gerber knows that limiting the saw’s design to cutting bone would only hinder its functionality. The coated carbon steel blade is a hybrid, optimized for cutting both bone and wood. This means you can use it to prep wild game, as well as to trim branches and improve your shooting lanes—plus any variety of camping or survival-specific uses, from building a shelter to gathering camouflage.<br>
<strong>Powerful, Ergonomic T-Grip</strong><br>
When it comes time to dress and prep an elk or moose, cutting through chest and pelvic bones demands power. This saw delivers with its ergonomic T-handle and sharp blade. The grip fits snugly and comfortably in your hand, allowing you to drive the saw with confidence, efficiently making cuts where needed. And a saw is only as good as it is sharp, so it comes with a plastic sheath to protect the teeth while stowed in your pack.</p>

- The hybrid medium-tooth saw cuts both bone and wood efficiently<br>
- T-handle with molded rubber grip offers comfortable and confident grip<br>
- Titanium nitride PVD-coated high carbon steel blade resists corrosion<br>
- Plastic sheath protects blade while stowed<br>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>When it’s time to dress your whitetail in the field, a fixed blade knife offers unmatched control, blade security and the all-around utility that hunting demands. From prepping game to setting up camp, the Moment Large Fixed Blade Knife is a utilitarian tool with a 3.63-inch fine edge drop point blade to handle tasks big and small. Add full tang construction and an ergonomic grip, and you’ve got a seriously capable knife that feels as great as it performs.<br>
<strong>Comfortable and Balanced</strong><br>
The first thing you’ll notice when you handle this knife is the comfortable grip and balanced feel of its design. The ergonomic shape of its textured rubber handle is reminiscent of a familiar tool. The handle instills confidence for pushing and pulling actions, and feels secure in all conditions. A well-placed guard, thumb traction jimping and the choil speak to Gerber’s more than 60 years of crafting hunting knives. You can rest assured this tool has plenty of hands-on experience behind its feel and function.<br>
<strong>Rises to the Occasion</strong><br>
No two hunting trips are the same. Each outing puts different demands on you and your equipment, your knife included. A versatile hunting blade needs to handle anticipated work like cleaning game and camp tasks, as well as the unforeseen prying and scraping duties that are sure to arise. The drop point shape allows for great control and ease of use, while its full tang design and glass bead finish are up for the unexpected demands of any hunting trip. The full-size blade is as versatile as it is stout, so you can focus on the adventure of the hunt, not whether you have the right tool for the job.<br>
<strong>Rugged Nylon Scabbard</strong><br>
The Moment Fixed Blade slides easily into its nylon scabbard for safekeeping in your pack. Strap the sheath on your belt and your knife is within easy reach; there’s a metal snap closure to keep the knife securely seated where it belongs while you battle the brush to locate your game or find the perfect camp.</p>

                        <h3>GERBER GDC Zip Blade - Essentials</h3>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>Gerber knows being prepared isn’t a state of being so much as a philosophy. Which is why having the right tool on hand is about little things that make the difference. Sometimes the job’s as simple as cutting twine or slicing open a box, but try those things without a blade enough times and you’ll appreciate the compact efficiency of the GDC Zip Blade.<br>
Part of Gerber’s Daily Carry collection, this Zip Blade is the bulldog of utility knives. Squat enough to fit in the palm of your hand, it has enough muscle to strip wire, cut cardboard, and slice through toughest of clamshell packaging.<br>
<strong>Eveready Blade</strong><br>
The quick-release clip lets you remove this tool with one hand, leaving your other one free to steady a load or keep things aligned. When open, a frame lock keeps the compact .68-inch fine edge blade secure, so there’s no wobble when you’re powering through a cut. A built-in fob lets you attach it to the zipper of your jacket or bag, so it’s close at hand when you need it.</p>

                        <h3>GERBER Moment Pocket Folder - Hunting</h3>
                        <div style=""clear:both;"">
                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>Having a capable blade in your pocket at all times is part of being prepared. Pocket-size and utilitarian by design, the Moment Folding Knife is an everyday carry blade designed to complement your larger, more task-specific hunting knives. This handy Gerber knife is slim in profile and big on small details that make a difference in its performance and feel.<br>
<strong>Slender Profile, Smooth Engagement</strong><br>
The slender stainless handle is well matched to its 3-inch drop point blade and, when closed, the knife slips naturally into your pocket. At only 2.5 ounces—half the weight of most smartphones—it won’t weigh you down either. The blade’s smooth engagement matches the refined look of the knife’s glass bead finish and clean, modern styling. Plus, it makes it easy to open and put to use for anything from cutting rope to gutting a fish.<br>
<strong>The Right Details</strong><br>
Gerber’s decades of know-how designing knives shine in the clean simplicity of this folder’s features. A rubber inlay molded into the all-stainless design gives positive grip. Dual thumb studs allow for one-handed blade opening, while the otherwise clean handle offers a modest guard and useful thumb pad on the spine. Add a nicely machined frame lock, and you’ve got a blade that stays put for routine and unforeseen tasks.<br>
<strong>Removable Pocket Clip</strong><br>
At exactly 4 inches long when closed, this knife is an easy addition to your daily wardrobe. Use the stout stainless steel clip to keep it securely accessible at the top of your favorite pocket, or remove it for a less-is-more approach.</p>

- Glass bead blade finish for low reflectivity and fewer fingerprints<br>
- Integrated frame lock provides bomber blade security<br>
- 3-inch fine edge blade is versatile and easy to sharpen<br>

                            <p><strong>Category:</strong> Modular<br>
<strong>Level:</strong> Pro<br>
<strong>Shell:</strong> Fibre<br>
<strong>Shell Structure:</strong> Pure Carbon......<strong><u>What is Pure Carbon?</u></strong> The Carbon fiber is the most-used fiber in high performance applications. It is obtained by carbonization of the PAN fiber (Polyacrylonitrile). Lazer chose to use High Modulus (HM) fibers, obtained by a burning temperature of 1800 to 2000°C.<br>
<strong>N° of Shell:</strong> 1<br>
<strong>Weight (size L):</strong> 1.350 g.<br>
<strong>Homologation:</strong><br>
- Double Homologation (Full-face and Jet)<br>
- ECE 22.05<br>
<strong>Buckle:</strong> Micrometric<br>
<strong>Visor:</strong> Lumino visor (Photochromic) Pinlock® provided<br>
To know more about Lumino Visor, <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9CoLJh6aWss"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE</a></strong><br>
<strong>Visor Fixation:</strong><br>
- Multi compressible tubular visor seal<br>
- Quarter-turn screw<br>
<strong>Number of reflective Zone:</strong> 3<br>
<strong>Rear Reflector:</strong> Yes<br>
<strong>EPS:</strong><br>
- EPS-Optimized upper insert protection<br>
- Quadruple density internal shell......<strong><u>What is EPS?</u></strong> Just like the outer shell, the inner shell, typically made of EPS (expanded polystyrene), is built to absorb impacts. As it is in near-contact with the head, the inner shell needs to be softer so that it itself does not damage the head when absorbing an impact. Lazer typically uses a triple-density construction, so as to bring an optimal phasing in the absorption process, with denser EPS against the shell and looser EPS against the head. Again, just like with the outer shell, we want to create a gradual fracturing process, with consecutive yielding points.<br>
<strong>Ventilation:</strong><br>
- Air Nets<br>
- Full Air System (FAS)<br>
<strong>N° of ventilations:</strong> 5<br>
<strong>Interior:</strong><br>
- 100% removable and washable<br>
- Morpho System Plus<br>
- SILVERPLUS®, antimicrobial and ecological textile (in running change)<br>
<strong>Comfort:</strong><br>
- Acoustic collar for noise reduction<br>
- Flexible nose deflector<br>
- Flexible removable chin curtain<br>
- One hand easy opening<br>
- Removable noise reduction pads<br>
<strong>Helmet bag:</strong> Specific helmet bag<br>
<strong>Communication system:</strong> Lazer Blue and Lazer Link pre-cabled<br>
<strong>Guarantee:</strong> 5 years (2 years + 3 years if registered)<br>

                            <h4>Specification: </h4>
                            <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 51 litres / 1,95 kg / h 69 x w 36 x d 32.<br>
<strong>Easy Storage: </strong>Pockets: 1 in, 3 ext + mesh pockets, 1 in belt. Front access with wide zip.<br>
<strong>Anatomic Design:</strong> Automatic back adjustment. Carrying system designed for women.<br>
<strong>Efficiency: </strong>Freedom of movement. ""Air cooling"" certified ventilation. Rain cover.<br>
<strong>Full Pack Dimensions: </strong>66 x 35 x 29 cm (Height x Width x Depth).<br>
<strong>How to pack a Backpack: </strong>Put your bedding in the bottom. Put heavy gear (tent, portable stove, food) near the back. Pack your clothes around these items. The groundsheet should be placed under the flap and the tent beneath the pack if there is no space inside. Keep a rainproof jacket and fleece close to hand. Small items for daily use (sun cream, map, glasses...) should be placed in the pockets. Usually, there is a compartment along the back for a hydration pack.<br>
<strong>How to adjust the back Height: </strong>Position the adjustment at the appropriate assumed height then adjust the bag (see ""How to adjust your bag?""). With the belt on your pelvis, the straps should go round the front part of your shoulders, and the load adjuster straps (sometimes also height-adjustable) describing an angle of around 45° (they must not go horizontally or vertically). If, in the test, the back seems too short or too long, readjust and try again, until you are satisfied.<br>
<strong>Symbium 3 System: </strong>The Symbium 3 combines the advantages of the Symbium (freedom of movement) with those of the new exclusive system of 3 pockets easy to move to the front of chest: easy to access multiple objects during walk, and shifting weight towards the front when these pockets are positioned at front. Consequently this helps to better distribute the carrying load and therefore raise the back by approx. 4 degrees. This reduces stress placed on the back and the load is carried with greater ease.<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong><br>
- Outer fabric: 100% PES<br>
- Inner fabric: 100% PA<br>
- Padding: 100% polyurethane.<br>
<strong>Restricted Use:</strong> Carrying to check if you are more than 1.8m (5ft 11 inches) tall<br>
<strong>Storage:</strong> Store your bag in a dry place.<br>
<strong>Care Instructions: </strong>To ensure materials retain their properties (especially waterproofing), we recommend you do not machine-wash backpacks, do not tumble dry, dry clean or use bleach. Do not iron. To clean your backpack by hand, use warm soapy water and a brush if necessary. After a few years, you can re-apply the water repellent properties of the fabric using a waterproofing spray.<br>

- Knox Dry Inside is water and stain repellent on the outside<br>
- Knox Dry Inside is antibacterial and odour resistant<br>

                            <p>The Proviz Flare is a brand new multi-purpose lighting device designed for you to use no matter your nightime activity: Cycling, running, walking, horse-riding, camping. Simply clip the caribiner clip on to a hook or loop on your bag, bike saddle or jacket. Or simply hold it if you are out walking the dog.<br>
When attached, the Flare not only emits a sharp eye catching light, but the natural movement of your body will create it to sway and attract maximum attention to yourself when out on the roads at night. Powered by two AA batteries the Flare will give you approximately 60-70 hours burn time.<br>
The sharp electroluminescent light emmitted by the Proviz Flare is the ultimate night light device. Designed to light you up so you are clearly visible and safer on the roads.</p>

                            <p>Our PROVIZ high visibility cycling gloves are the perfect glove for your ride. The fluorescent yellow material along with the reflective trim helps to keep you visible whilst the tri-laminated fleece-lined protection helps to keep you warm yet allow heat and moisture to escape. The gloves differ from standard fleece-lined gloves in that the fleece is not touching the skin, it is instead the middle layer.

<strong>LFS - Light Fit System:</strong> The aim was to develop a system that holds the helmet quickly, safely and yet more comfortably against the head.

                            <p>The Cold Killers Softshell collection has been re-engineered with a focus on style, fit, soft feel and overall comfort.<br>
<br>
The new collection features Softshell fabric providing active stretch, windproof and breathable performance combined with great water resistance. The Softshell fabric is a three ply laminate with a very tough and tightly woven stretch fabric on the outside with a cosy 3D fleece liner. In between is a laminated membrance, which assists weather protection.<br>
<br>
These three elements work together to deliver an incredible balance of protection against wind and rain, excellent breathability, balanced wamth and soft stretch fit.<br>
<br>
The technical combination of Softshell fabric and 3D fleece allows warm air to circulate easily, thereby dramatically reducing the overheat/chill-down cycle associated with conventional layering.</p>

                            <p>The ultimate road-helmet for cycling enthusiasts. The updated CARBO WING technology and the integrated carbon- and fibreglass compound segments provide a superstrong yet lightweight helmet structure and allow the oversized vents. The advanced inner vent architecture maximizes the flow of air. Now it is time to experience the new benchmark in competition helmets.</p>

                            <p><strong>Material:  </strong>Carbon reinforcement.<br>
<strong>Weight:  </strong>250 g.<br>
<strong>Ventilation:</strong> 24 Air vents.<br>
<strong>LFS - Light Fit System:</strong> The aim was to develop a system that holds the helmet quickly, safely and yet more comfortably against the head. The adjustment mechanism is particularly small and light; it is effortlessly simple to adjust the size using just two fingers. In addition, the height of the LFS can be vertically adjusted to three positions, guaranteeing an optimal fit. Perfect arrangement of the straps ensures unrestricted wearing comfort for men and women. Higher performance with a 15% reduction in weight for a 100% more efficient system!<br>
<strong>Air Channel Technology:</strong> Due to an inner vent channel system the perfect flow of incoming and outgoing air is guaranteed and leads CRATONI helmets to outstanding ventilation results.<br>
<strong>Impact Carcass Technology:</strong> The overall helmet structure is reinforced through an additional inner carcass.<br>
<strong>Inmold Technology:</strong> The EPS material is directly foamed into the outer shell which makes up for a perfect fusion of the two materials. As a result, an extremely safe and solid overall-construction develops and weight is kept at a very low level.<br>
<strong>Netpad - Changeable:</strong> Decide on your own wether to use an Insect Protection or not. Be on the safe side in any case with your optimal insertable insect net.<br>
<strong>Carbo Wing:</strong> Integrated carbon frames spread out forces to the entire helmet structure in case of impact and guarantee maximum safety standards.<br>
<strong>Coolmax® Pads:</strong> Keep a cool head on hard climbs thanks to the good ventilation performance and the breathable COOLMAX® inner lining.<br>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The REFLECT360 cycling jacket is the world's first to be designed using a 100% reflective outer-shell. The jacket's high quality material is designed to look and feel great while keeping the weather out. The reflective ability of the material helps other road users to identify a cyclist’s position on the road at night giving them an extra few seconds of time to react and manoeuvre appropriately.<br>
<br>
The REFLECT360 jacket incorporates multiple vents - front, shoulder/back and under arm. This allows the user to regulate body temperature. By opening the front zipper vents a 'through-flow' is achieved. The air enters the front vents, cools the body and exits via the shoulder/back vents. During the winter, the vents can be closed and are designed to also be used as extra pockets if required. These features enable the jacket to be used all year round.  The jacket also has an inside chest pocket and large lower back pocket to store an extra layers or a map.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fabric:</strong> The fabric used for the REFLECT360 range is highly technical. During daylight it is a modest grey colour. At night, when the fabric picks up an external light source, eg vehicle headlights, it gives ‘astonishing reflectivity’ (quote: Cycling Active Magazine Sep:2014). The material is CE EN 20471 certified.</p>

                            <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.6 Kg<br>
<strong>Size:</strong> Bedroom: 2.25m long x 1.95m wide.<br>
<strong>Poles: </strong>Solid fibreglass; highly break resistant.<br>
<strong>Capacity: </strong>Fine for 3, great for 2. 2 big adjustable ventil. flaps (Air Cooling System®).<br>
<strong>Easy to Use: </strong>Instant pitching. Can be folded in 15 secs if you have the knack. Free-standing.<br>
<strong>UV Protection: </strong>Our tent fabrics block over 98% of UVB and 80 to 95% of UVA rays... for those looking for daytime protection, remember that a lot of UV rays can enter through one open door.<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong> PU-coated polyester flysheet, breathable polyester bedroom, polyethylene groundsheet, solid fibreglass poles.<br>
<strong>Ventilation: </strong>Air Cooling System label: 2 side panels on the flysheet can be opened up, allowing air into the bedroom through the mosquito netting (so the bedroom remains protected from insects). These panels can be left open even in the rain, and can be closed from the inside. This means that you get a good night's sleep on even the warmest of nights. It also allows you to safely see what's going on outside.<br>
<strong>Care Instructions:</strong><br>
- CLEANING: if need be, clean the tent with soapy water then rinse (with a hose if possible). Then dry completely.<br>
- RESIN STAINS (very hard to remove): once the stain is dry, gently scratch it off whilst holding an ice cube on the inside of the fabric to make the resin brittle so it will come off more easily.<br>
- STORAGE: after use or cleaning, do not store your tent until it is completely dry to prevent odours and mould formation.<br>

<strong>Care Instructions:</strong> Wash at 30°C. Use liquid detergent; do not add fabric conditioner. Fasten zips and rip-tabs before washing. With each wash, renew the fabric's water repellent properties using a suitable treatment. A complete range of products specially designed to help you care for waterproof and breathable fabrics is available in all Decathlon stores. These products will help you optimise your garment's performance throughout its lifespan.<br>
<strong>Compact:</strong> Light and compact garment for the bottom of your bag.<br>
<strong>Easy to use:</strong> Zip hems for easy dressing without having to take off your shoes.<br>
<strong>Tested:</strong> All our models are tested by users representative of our target market in conditions identical to those you will encounter yourself when using them. We believe that testing the product in real situation scenarios is the only way to design and constantly improve the technical suitability and style of our QUECHUA products.<br>
<strong>Water repellence:</strong> Water repellency is a fabric's ability to let water slide over its surface without seeping in. This prevents the fabric from swelling, and keeps it lightweight, breathable and warm. Water repellency is achieved through a treatment applied to the fabric's exterior. This treatment must be renewed throughout the garment's lifetime (after every wash).Water-repellent treatment products are available in our stores. All Quechua waterproof jackets have received a water-repellent treatment.<br>
<strong>Size:</strong> Wide cut. N.B. no seams possible because of the zips at the bottom of the legs.<br>
<strong>Pockets:</strong> 2 hand pockets.<br>
<strong>Stock Advice:</strong> Always make sure that this waterproof protective garment is completely dry before storing it.<br>

<strong>Storage:</strong> Easy storage: stuff it into its cover, feet first. To keep it fluffed up, which will ensure good thermal performance, remove its cover and store it somewhere dry.<br>
<strong>Care Instructions: </strong>Wash your bag separately from other delicate clothes or colours, fasten rip-tabs, loosen the hood, use 1/3 of a dose of washing powder, and select a synthetics cycle at 30°C. For drying, stretch the bag out in a dry and well-ventilated place out of the sun and away from heat sources, or tumble dry at a low temperature. Tip: using a sleeping bag liner allows you to wash your bag less often so it will retain its thermal properties.<br>

                            <p>The Cold Killers Softshell collection has been re-engineered for 2009 with a focus on style, fit, soft feel and overall comfort.<br>
<br>
The new collection features Softshell fabric providing active stretch, windproof and breathable performance combined with great water resistance. The Softshell fabric is a three ply laminate with a very tough and tightly woven stretch fabric on the outside with a cosy 3D fleece liner. In between is a laminated membrance, which assists weather protection.<br>
<br>
These three elements work together to deliver an incredible balance of protection against wind and rain, excellent breathability, balanced wamth and soft stretch fit.<br>
<br>
The technical combination of Softshell fabric and 3D fleece allows warm air to circulate easily, thereby dramatically reducing the overheat/chill-down cycle associated with conventional layering.</p>

<strong>Ease of use:</strong> Shell and inner fabric tough Ripstop polyamide. Quick dry.<br>
<strong>Maintenance:</strong> Avoid washing your bag with other garments or delicate colours. Close the hook-and-loop strap, loosen the hood fully, use 1/3 dose of soap powder and select the synthetic programme, 30°C. Hang to dry in a well-ventilated place, away from direct sunlight or heat sources, or tumble dry at low heat. Our tip: if you use a liner, you will not need to wash your sleeping bag as frequently, thus preserving its thermal performance over time.<br>

<strong>Storage instructions: </strong>To tidy your bag away easily, push it into the stuff sack starting with the bottom. Take the bag out of its stuff sack and store it in a dry place to retain the loft necessary for thermal performance.<br>

                            <p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> NOVADRY waterproof coating (2000 mm). 100% taped seams.<br>
<strong>Breathable:</strong> NOVADRY hydrophilic coating (RET=12): limits condensation inside the garment.<br>
<strong>Flexibility:</strong> Detachable hood.<br>
<strong>Hood:</strong> Removable using press studs. Height can be adjusted using an elastic drawcord and toggles. Adjustable depth using a rip-tab positioned at the back of the hood. Fitted visor provides good face protection.<br>
<strong>Pockets:</strong> 2 hand pockets + 1 outer chest pocket + 1 secret Napoleon style pocket hidden under the main flap. All 4 pockets are zipped. Pockets are NOT waterproof.<br>
<strong>Technical:</strong> Dual-material lining: Mesh around the upper body to enhance the garment's breathability / nylon around the hips to optimise ease of movement and resistance to wear.<br>
<strong>Waterproofing Test:</strong> We measure a fabric's resistance to a column of water in mm (based on the ISO 811 standard). The higher the water pressure withstood, the more waterproof the fabric. A waterproof rating of 2000 mm means the fabric can withstand the pressure exerted by 2000 mm of water (the equivalent of a rain shower lasting for two hours).<br>
<strong>Water repellence:</strong> A fabric is water repellent when it allows water slide over its surface without seeping in. This prevents the fabric from swelling, and keeps it lightweight, breathable and warm. This is achieved through a treatment applied to the fabric's exterior. This treatment must be renewed throughout the garment's lifetime (recommended with each wash). Water repellent treatment products are available in our stores. All Quechua waterproof jackets have received a water repellent treatment.<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong> Outer fabric: 100% polyester. Lining: 100% polyester.<br>
<strong>Tested:</strong> All our products are field-tested by users who represent the target market in conditions identical to those found in typical use. We consider that real situation scenarios are the only way to create and constantly improve the technical relevance and the design of our QUECHUA products.<br>
<strong>Stock Advice:</strong> Always make sure that this waterproof protective garment is completely dry before storing it.<br>
<strong>Care Instructions:</strong> Wash at 30°C. Use liquid detergent; do not add fabric conditioner. Fasten zips and rip-tabs before washing. With each wash, renew the fabric's water repellent properties using a suitable treatment. A complete range of products specially designed to help you care for waterproof and breathable fabrics is available in all Decathlon stores. These products will help you optimise your garment's performance throughout its lifespan.<br>

                            <h4>Specification: </h4>
                            <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Room 120 cm wide by 205 cm in length. Max. headroom: 110 cm. Folded:Cylindrical storage case: 16cm diameter / 57cm long.<br>
<strong>Durability:</strong> Wind resistance: validated in wind tunnels and on a rotating plate.<br>
<strong>Easy to use:</strong> Flysheet to protect you from condensation. Free standing structure.<br>
<strong>Capacity:</strong> Sleeping width: 60 cm/person. Pole curve design maximises space.<br>
<strong>Poles:</strong> Hollow fibreglass poles (2 diameters Ø 7.9 and 8.5mm)<br>
<strong>Pegs:</strong> 6 x 5 mm galvanised steel pegs for very good twisting resistance.<br>
<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.4kg.<br>
<strong>Storage:</strong> 2 pockets for storing you things in the bedroom.<br>
<strong>Pitching / folding:</strong> Classic dome tent assembly: poles set up with the bedroom then flysheet fixed on top. Reverse movement to take it down.<br>
<strong>Ventilation:</strong> 1 high up back vent space between the flysheet and the floor all round the tent: to allow air to circulate between the bedroom and fly sheet for more breathability and to limit natural condensation.<br>
<strong>Entrance/exit:</strong> 1 vertical zip for the outer door. A ""D"" zip for the inner room. The entry way can be left open rolled up and fixed to the pole.<br>
<strong>Windproofing:</strong> We test all of our tents in a wind tunnel and on a rotating plate to expose each side of the tent to the wind. A properly assembled tent with all the stays in position around the tent should remain habitable;e under wind speeds measuring 50 km/h at ground level.<br>
<strong>UV Protection:</strong> The fabric flysheet filters UV rays with a SPF of 30. Please note: a significant amount of UV rays can enter through a single open door: protect your skin.<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong> Flysheet: 2000mm schmerber PU-coated polyester. Bedroom: breathable polyester. Ground sheet: polyethylene. Fibreglass poles.<br>
<strong>Restriction of use:</strong> Compatible with 2-person mattresses with max width 120cm.<br>
<strong>Care Instructions:</strong><br>
1) CLEANING - if needed clean the tent with soapy water then rinse (with a hose if possible). Then leave to dry completely.<br>
2) TREE SAP STAINS - Can be very hard to remove Once the stain is fully dry gently scratch it off while holding an ice cube on the inside of the fabric to make the sap brittle so it will come off more easily.<br>
3) STORAGE - after use or cleaning do not store your tent until it is perfectly dry to prevent odours and mould from forming.<br>

                            <h4>Description: </h4>
                            <p>The Cold Killers Softshell collection has been re-engineered for 2009 with a focus on style, fit, soft feel and overall comfort.<br>
<br>
The new collection features Softshell fabric providing active stretch, windproof and breathable performance combined with great water resistance. The Softshell fabric is a three ply laminate with a very tough and tightly woven stretch fabric on the outside with a cosy 3D fleece liner. In between is a laminated membrance, which assists weather protection.<br>
<br>
These three elements work together to deliver an incredible balance of protection against wind and rain, excellent breathability, balanced wamth and soft stretch fit.<br>
<br>
The technical combination of Softshell fabric and 3D fleece allows warm air to circulate easily, thereby dramatically reducing the overheat/chill-down cycle associated with conventional layering.</p>

<strong>Bedroom Space: </strong>This Base Seconds was designed as the living area for 2 Seconds tents, during cold, rainy, or mosquito-filled evenings. It therefore does not have a bedroom, but is compatible with 2 Seconds bedrooms. A bedroom is sold separately to fix inside the Base Seconds, converting it to a wide 2 to 4-man tent for sleeping.<br>

All Base Seconds tents can be twinned together, or with a Base Seconds Full or even a Base Seconds XL, extending the sheltered area from 5 to 10 sqm or 15 sqm or more. See demonstration video.<br>

<strong>Ventilation: </strong>1 air vent under each of the 3 ""overhangs"", 4 mosquito net windows (can be closed off) + 1 ceiling air vent. Designed for optimum ventilation and to reduce natural condensation.<br>

                            <h4>Specification: </h4>
                            <p><strong>Composition:</strong> PU-coated polyester flysheet, breathable polyester bedroom, polyethylene ground sheet, 8.5mm diameter fibreglass poles.<br>
<strong>Care instructions:</strong><br>
- CLEANING: if need be, clean the tent with soapy water then rinse (with a hose if possible). Then dry completely.<br>
- RESIN STAINS (very hard to remove): once the stain is dry, gently scratch it off whilst holding an ice cube on the inside of the fabric to make the resin brittle so it will come off more easily.<br>
- STORAGE: after use or cleaning, do not store your tent until it is completely dry to prevent odours and mould formation.<br>
<strong>Ventilation: </strong>2 high ventilations (front and back), space between flysheet and ground all the way round. Everything is designed so that air circulates between the bedroom and flysheet, for better breathability and to limit natural condensation.<br>
<strong>Tent pegs: </strong>5mm galvanised steel pegs for good twisting resistance.<br>
<strong>Cover Tube: </strong>25cm diameter/55cm long.<br>
<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.1m x 2m bedroom. 1.1m storage bell end<br>
<strong>Weight: </strong>4.6kg.<br>
<strong>Bedroom space: </strong>Inner tent is comfortable for 3 adults, very comfortable for 2.<br>
<strong>Storage space: </strong>Generous storage bell end.<br>
<strong>Door: </strong>The big door opens fully in a single movement, meaning you don't have to crawl into the tent , which you will soon come to appreciate.<br>
<strong>Pitching/folding: </strong>Classic dome pitch: put up the poles with the inner tent, then add the flysheet to this structure and finally the bell end pole. To take down follow these steps in reverse.<br>
<strong>Poles: </strong>8.5mm hollow fibreglass poles.<br>
<strong>Waterproofing:</strong> Like all Quechua tents, the waterproofing has been particularly well-developed, approved in lab tests (WHOLE TENT in a shower of 200 litres/h/m²!) and in field tests (polyurethane-coated polyester flysheet; 120g/m² polyethylene groundsheet; sealed thermo-bonded seams). You will note that a breathable polyester inner tent beneath the flysheet means no contact with the condensation that naturally occurs inside the flysheet.<br>
<strong>UV protection:</strong> Our tent fabrics block over 98% of UVB and 80 to 95% of UVA rays... for those looking for daytime protection, remember that a lot of UV rays can enter through one open door.<br>
