Specifications:

Options:


Stiffness of Shaft

Medium (Flexible)
Partial transfer of energy from wrist action. Flexible shaft stores energy at swing motion giving more repulsion of shuttlecock at impact from the racket. Good for defensive and control play style (clears overheads returning smashes etc...)
Stiff (Limited Flexibility)
Reasonable transfer of energy from wrist action good for both defensive and offensive play style
Extra Stiff (Minimum Flexibility)
Maximum transfer of energy from wrist action. Minimum shaft movement gives high accuracy on shuttlecock positioning. Ideal for offensive play style (smashing net kill etc...)
 
Some manufacturers show increasing stiffness by decreasing value. For example SOTX and Tactic indicate stiff shaft as 8.0-8.5 and flexible shaft as 9.0-9.5.
