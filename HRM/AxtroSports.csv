What is it?

Your Wahoo Blue SC is a Bluetooth Smart cycling speed/cadence sensorthat mounts on the rear chain stay of most bikes and tracks speed,cadence and distance as magnets on the spoke and crank pass by thesensor.  It stores and sends that data to any Bluetooth Smart Readydevice, such as the iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPod Touch (5th generation), iPad (3rd and 4th generations) for tracking and analyzing. 

 How do I install it?

Place the sensor on the rear chain stay of your bike, near thepedal. The logo should be facing up and the arm of the senor should beinside the rear chain stay, facing down.
Secure the sensor in place with provided rubber band or zip ties, whichever you prefer.
Take off the pedal on the same side and slip the pedal magnet ontothe crank, magnet facing in towards the sensor, aligning so that it willpass by the body of the Wahoo Blue SC sensor. Replace your pedal.
Screw the wheel magnet onto any spoke on your back wheel, facing in,aligning so that it will pass by the arm of the Wahoo Blue SC sensor.
Make sure the magnets are aligned to pass by the sensor as the crank and wheel spin.
Once in place, move within 5’ - 10’ of any device that receives Bluetooth Smart wireless data, such as the iPhone 5.

 How do I pair my Wahoo Blue SC using the Wahoo Fitness App?

Open the Wahoo Fitness App
Tap the wrench icon in the top right for settings
Choose Workout Settings
Select the Workout Type
Choose Add Sensor
Select ""Combo Speed &amp; Cad""
Spin the pedals and/or wheel to activate the Wahoo Blue SC logo. You might also see the BT logo flash.
Once connected, click Save in the top right

 It won't connect! What do I do?

If you do not get a reading, or the readings are erroneous, ensurethat the magnets are aligned to pass by the sensor as the crank andwheel spin.  The Wahoo Blue SC ‘sleeps’ with inactivity so you'll needto spin the pedals and/or wheel to activate. If you're still havingtrouble, download the Wahoo Utility App to test your sensor.

 How do I pair the Wahoo Blue SC with other Apps?

Make sure the Bluetooth setting on your device is turned on and that you have latest version of your favorite compatible app. 
Each App is a little different, but be sure to pair the sensor in the App, NOT in Bluetooth settings on your phone. 

 How do I change the battery?

The battery is located behind a cover on the back of the sensor andcan be replaced by placing a coin in the slot and turning the cover 1/4turn counterclockwise. Replace with a 3 volt CR2032 battery (contact alocal waste handling group for proper disposal of old battery).

Freestyle Hand Paddle,"


Details

Freestyler Hand PaddleThe Freestyler Paddle is a patented hand paddle designed to improve technique specifically for the freestyle stroke. Unlike previous generations of hand paddles, the Freestyler is not designed for resistance and strength training, but applies a hydrodynamic shape to decrease resistance through the water, thereby improving reach and distance per stroke.The Freestyler's unique shape and 'skeg' design forces streamlined hand entry which lengthens each arm stroke. A longer stroke creates a better pull through, a better hip-rotation, and ultimately increases performance. Features &amp; Benefits Small, Streamlined Shape: Decreases resistance through the water in order to improve reach and distance-per-stroke. Patented 'Skeg' Along Underneath of Paddle: Creates a gliding effect in the front of each Freestyle pull, which in turn elongates the entire stroke cycle. Cut out Wrist Shape: Helps eliminate stress on shoulders and prevent injuries. Flexible Rubber Tubing: Straps to fingers to lock paddle in place. Product Video

They are designed to provide the ideal amount of propulsion for perfecting the swimming kick and stroke, allowing for better form over longer periods of time. Because they have a smaller blade than traditional fins, Zoomers make the legs work harder without overloading the muscles. They help you avoid burnout and sustain an optimum workout level over a longer period. Zoomers fins allow you to practice swimming at or above race-level speeds without being rested or shaved. For each speed in the water, there is a size of the kick that works best. The kick creates propulsion that moves you forward, but each time the legs separate in the flutter kick, they create drag which slows you down. At higher speeds, the drag created can potentially cancel out the extra effort put in. A smaller kick creates less drag, but also less propulsion. Zoomers are designed to help practice and perfect this smaller kick by providing just enough extra propulsion while avoiding additional drag. Red vs. Blue Zoomers: Zoomers come in two models. Red for advanced competitive swimmers with a developed, strong kick, and blue for swimmers who are looking for a strength-training workout. Features &amp; Benefits   To get a great workout, you must exercise a large percentage of the body's muscle mass at a reasonably high level of intensity for a long period of time or over a long distance. Due to the nature of swimming, swimmers often fall below this optimum level of workout, usually due to the difficulty in sustaining an efficient kick. Zoomers make the legs work harder, but the smaller blade will not overload leg muscles, therefore a high level of intensity can be maintained for a longer period of time. The additional propulsion allows the arms to cycle faster, providing the opportunity to breathe more and increase the oxygen intake needed to sustain the effort of the leg muscles. We do not race at slow speeds, yet most workouts are done at sub-race speeds. Therefore, we spend much of our time practicing techniques for slower swimming - a different size kick, speed, arm turnover rate, body planing position and arm entry angle. Zoomers make it possible to practice correct race pace techniques for extended periods of time. With Zoomers you can train at or above race speeds, resulting in improvements to high-speed neuromuscular coordination and a reduction in the upper-body stress associated with sprint training. The core of your workout is improved, allowing you to become a better swimmer with a stronger, faster kick. Product Video

Z2 Zoomers,"


Details

Z2 Fin 
By dramatically improving efficiency, swimmers are able to push the limits in their training. The new Zoomer Z2 swim fins are specially designed to improve the effectiveness of one's swim workouts by creating an easier kicking movement. The channel on the bottom of the Zoomer Z2 captures water to provide ideal propulsion for longer distances, while the back ridges strengthen the hamstrings and glutes.

Like the original Zoomer fins, the Zoomer Z2 fins are shorter in length than standard swim fins. They utilize a patented angle and quick response technology to promote a shorter, faster kick that makes the legs work harder while reducing the occurrence of burnout.
Features &amp; Benefits
Patented Short-Blade Construction:
Promotes a small, fast kick while increasing proper leg strength. 

Fluid Separator:
Creates a 'natural extension of the foot' so that the foot can slice through the water with ease. 

Channel Convertors:

PT Paddles,"


Details

PT Paddles
Swimming is not a natural form oflocomotion, and as a result technique can be more important thanphysical strength and fitness. Effective swimming involves the use ofthe whole body working with the water, not fighting against it.
PT Paddles are designed to help you find and develop your Perfect Technique in the water. The proper use of the paddles will improve the technical aspects of your stroke:

Increase Coordination
Build Core Strength
Create a ""Feel for the Water""
Maximize Distance per Stroke

How they Work:
PTPaddles are shaped to deflect water around your hand, effectivelyremoving the hands from the swimming equation. By removing the hand as apaddle, swimmers have to find other methods of generating propulsion.Because your hand can no longer 'grip' the water, your body will needto adjust your stroke. The elbow is positioned higher, the hips roll alittle further, and the forearm is activated earlier, allowing you tocatch and pull yourself through the water.Wearing the PTPaddles overtime increases your body awareness and muscle memory. Thenwhen you swim normally without the paddles, you will feel stronger andfaster in the water.
Features &amp; Benefits
Features:

Ergonomicallydesigned for comfort and made of engineered materials with a verysimilar density to water to create a natural swimming stroke
Comprised of durable PU material that is UV and chlorine resistant
Textured upper surface for grip

Benefits:

Encourages a higher elbow to pull with
Creates a slight instability in the water, teaching you to stabilize with your core muscles
Heightens your senses and enhances your 'feel for the water'
Decreases stress around the shoulder joint and surrounding muscles and reducing the possibility of injury
Increases 'body awareness' and improves overall coordination and timing
Improves hip rotation, allowing you to generate more power from each stroke

SpeedBox,"


Details

SpeedBox
Resistance Swimming The SpeedBox provides progressive resistance, where the resistance increases as the swimmer goes down the pool away from the device. The initial load is low to allow for a good push-off or dive start. Thereafter, the overload principle from land training is used to develop strength and power while swimming.
Assisted SwimmingAssisted swimming uses stored potential energy in the SpeedBox to tow the swimmer through the water. Starting from 20-25 meters away, the swimmer swims toward the SpeedBox and is assisted down the pool, up to approximately 5 meters from the wall. As a result the swimmer experiences faster swim and recovery speeds. Furthermore, the swimmer becomes more conscious of slower drag forces, allowing them to strive for perfect technique throughout the swim.
Features and Benefits

Bungie Cord Provides a minimum level of resistance that increases as it stretches
Pulley SystemCreates constant, smooth and even tension
Portable DesignReduces to just (24”x 20”x 8”) for ease of transport
Power SpringsChoose between 3 power levels for variable tiers of resistance and assistance

Tech Toc,"


Details

Tech Toc  The Tech Toc is a friendly, introductory product to hiptraining. It utilizes a ball bearing inside of a plastic capsulecontaining acoustical amplifiers at each end. As the swimmer rotatestheir hips while training, the ball hits each end of the capsule,providing the swimmer audible feedback on their hip rotation andmovement. The device allows swimmers to hear, as well as feel the rhythmand pace of their stroke pattern and technique. The Tech Toc can beused by any age group for any swim distance or stroke.
Features &amp; Benefits
Patented Audible Feedback Capsule: Provides instant feedback during each hip-rotation so that the swimmer completes full rotations from side to side.Adjustable Hip Belt: Accommodates swimmers of all shapes and sizes.Set Capsule Vertically or Horizontally: Thread belt horizontally for Freestyle and Backstroke hip-rotationdrills. Thread belt vertically for Butterfly and Breaststroke undulationdrills.'Delay' Setting: Delays the ball bearing from hitting each capsule end, which forces the swimmer to exaggerate their hip training.

ROM Strap,"


Details

ROM (Rang of Motion) Strap
The ROM Strap facilitates safe stretching of the sheet muscles which run from the shoulder blade to the torso. Enhanced streamlining and body roll combined with increased power output are the benefits of improved range of motion.

Features &amp; Benefits
The ROM Strap is designed to help stretch the arms, shoulders, shoulder blades, upper torso and rib cage. The ROM Strap passively retains each hand. This passive retention allows the transmission of pulling or traction forces up the arm without the need to contract the muscles of the hand, forearm and upper arm as would be necessary if the hands were not passively retained. This allows more effective stretching of the upper body.

Sizing
The ROM Strap should be safley used by people ages 14 and over.

WARNING: It is very important to stretch cautiously so no shoulder damage occurs. The shoulder is a muscle-retained joint: that is, the muscles which are in the area of the shoulder hold the shoulder joint together. To prevent injury, it is necessary to keep the muscles which hold the shoulder joint together lightly contracted so the shoulder is safe, while allowing other muscles of the area to relax so they can be stretched.

Training Tips
While both variables, distance per kick and tempo (speed of movement), must be emphasized from the start in skill development and training, a bias should be directed to more emphasis upon distance per kick.
It is important to incorporate the use of the core body strength into power development in the kicking motion. Keeping the body too rigid, with the kick inside the body alignment, will result in diminished distance per kick. Let the hand, arms and body go for bigger range of motion and more distance per kick. Use exaggerated
movements in your training.
Measure you distance per kick by counting kicks over a given distance. Measure tempo by timing a specific number of kick, and determine seconds per kick (example: .45 seconds per kick)
You can also learn and practice kicking on your side (Fish Kicking), rather than on your front (Dolphin Kicking)

Dry Top Attachment,"


Details

Snorkel Dry-Top - For Swimmer's Snorkel

Patented design helps keep your snorkel free of water.

* When submerging under the water, a small buoy inside the Dry-Top rises, effectively sealing the tube.
* Water is then prevented from entering, keeping your snorkel completely dry!
* When you surface, the buoy drops, opening the air passage for maximum airflow.


* For use on FINIS Swimmer's Snorkels only.
* Not compatible with the ""Freestyle Snorkel"" or ""Learn-to-Swim Snorkel"".

Note that using the Snorkel Dry Top will slightly restrict air-flow into the tube. The Dry-Top attachment is recommended for experienced users.

Turnmaster Pro,"


Details

A state of the art portable bulkhead made using aerospace technology for lightness, durability and stiffness that allows you to optimize your pool space to any configuration. Practice turns, teach lessons, etc.
Coaches can now add a divider in the middle of each lane, adding 2 additional walls per lane.  Up to 50% of short course race success can be contributed to underwater swimming. Drastically increasing practice space and underwater drills will make a significant difference in overall race performance.
Made of Vinyl Ester Chlorine Resistant Fiberglass the Turnmaster Pro can withstand race speed turns and is resistant to chlorine damage. Wheels are built into the bottom for easy maneuvering on land; one person can easily load the Turnmaster Pro in a car and wheel it to the pool by themselves. Once in the pool two swimmers can easily attach the Turnmaster Pro to lane lines in less than 5 minutes.
Invented by Bill Kirby, gold medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as part of the 4×200m freestyle relay team, he realized the importance of underwater training “It is physics, the faster you throw a ball against a wall, the faster it will bounce off. It is the same idea with turns, the faster you come into the wall the faster you can come off of it. The Turnmaster Pro allows more swimmers to practice their turns, being a fiberglass wall also makes it less intimidating for younger swimmers to approach at full race speed. During a race your two fastest places are coming off the blocks and coming off the wall. Practicing all aspects of the flip turn including the approach, the turn and a tight streamline off the wall all play a key role in success during competitions. “

Pool-Mate Watch,"


Details

The Pool-Mate is the only fully automatic lap and stroke counter for swimmers. It will work with all major strokes, all abilities of swimmer and all sizes of pool.Containing accurate motion sensors and our unique software algorithms, the Pool-Mate automatically recognises each swim stroke and change of lap so you don't have to count anymore. The Pool-Mate will display Lap count, Time, Average Strokes per lap, Speed, Distance, Calories and Efficiency, all completely automatically and store details in a large memory for recall at your leisure. As well as the statistics for the overall session it will record the same data for up to 99 individual sets per session so you can see how your data changes through a swim. A major leap forward from existing manual lap counters, our watches bring swimming into the 21st Century at last. Numerous studies and respected coaches stress the value of stroke counting as a valued way to improve swimming efficiency. Reducing the number of strokes per lap increases efficiency. The Pool-Mate has a unique swimming efficiency index that gives feedback about the efficiency of your swimming. By monitoring this so you can see how you improve over time. We have designed a complete bespoke watch specifically for swimmers. All aspects of the watch from the strap to the display and electronics have been designed by Swimovate. Features include lightweight, flexible PU strap, easy to read display, stainless steel buttons, backlight and double secure fastening. Technology The Pool-Mate uses state of the art MEMS accelerometers to measure the acceleration of the wrist during the swim stroke. Advanced digital signal processing techniques and software algorithms have been developed by our engineers to pick out the stroke and lap information for the recognised swimming strokes. Works with Front Crawl, BackCrawl, Breaststroke and Butterfly, all sizes of pool over 10m, without calibration. The Pool-Mate has been extensively tested by a wide variety of swimmers including members of Eton Triathlon Club. We have a database of hundreds of kms of swimming and an accuracy rate of over 99.75%. The watch has full CE and FCC approvals. Patents have been applied for. &gt;

BetterFly for Every Body (DVD),"

Illustrated in this DVD are two significant evolutions in our skill-building sequences for Butterfly:(1) An expedited path to whole stroke. While our freestyle drill sequence includes more than 10 steps, our new sequences for each stroke will have you swimming the whole stroke in just four to five steps. This will allow swimmers to more quickly begin integrating what they’ve been learning in whole-skill practice.(2) A more “organic” path to whole stroke. Our motivation for developing new sequences was a desire for every drill step to have clear relevance to the whole-stroke and for our sequences for all strokes to better match the seamless steps by which we teach Freestyle.Also featured in this DVD:1) Live lesson with Terry Laughlin –Terry demonstrates and explains every step, what it contributes to the overall skill and how it relates to other skills in the sequence. It’s like having a personal lesson with Terry. 2) Beneath the Surface –These segments were shot in a current pool, with both camera and swimmer stationary, allowing for lengthy study of the movements. We shot these segments from six different underwater and surface angles, including directly underneath and overhead. No instructional video has ever examined the strokes so thoroughly. 3) TI Coaches Practice – Watch TI coaches practice the key drills and the whole stroke, also from multiple angles. Also shows examples of “imperfect” skills illustrating likely stroke and drill errors to watch out for. 4) For Boomers – This section, never before included in any instructional video shows how to adapt your swimming to be better than ever in middle age. Though you may not be as strong or as supple as you were at 25, like Terry you can still swim your best by following the tips in this section.

02 in H20: A Self-Help Course on Breathing in Swimming (DVD),"


Details

Nothing is more essential to a swimmer than air. Yet few swimmers truly understand how to breathe efficiently. Not just to get air, but to integrate breathing seamlessly with the stroke. Breathing is sometimes viewed as a liability or inconvenience, but when you do it right, breathing can actually make your stroke better. This DVD shows you how.Contents:Introduction – Learn the two key skills of breathing: (1) Head-Spine Alignment and (2) Breathing with body movement.Water Bowl Exercises – Invaluable if you’ve never been comfortable in water. Useful for understanding subtleties you probably missed before, if you’re already a skilled swimmer.Shallow Water Exercises – Separate critical breathing skills from stroking. Rehearse them in simple ways. Breathe more efficiently as a result.Breathing Skills in Drills - A simple breathing technique that helps you drill better. And an advanced breathing technique that helps you transition from drill to swim better.Whole Stroke Breathing Skills – A detailed study with focal points for practice of breathing technique for Freestyle, Breaststroke and Butterfly.

Happy Laps (DVD),"


Details

Since 1989, Total Immersion has become a phenomenon among improvement-minded swimmers – the first program in the history of swimming instruction with “raving fans.” TI has become so popular because it:• Is simpler than any alternative.• Works with unprecedented dependability.• Makes swimming enjoyable and deeply satisfying.But the one thing TI has not been is available to people who were afraid of the water or who couldn’t swim at all…until now.Happy Laps is the first TI self-help tool to address the real basics: how do I swim without fear of sinking, how do I breathe in water, and how do I move with such efficiency that I will be able to swim graceful, nearly effortless laps for health, fitness or pleasure with absolute comfort and confidence.Why Happy Laps can turn anyone into a swimmer:This self-teaching video offers a simple, clear, common-sense approach to learning to move through the water easily, comfortably, and so pleasurably that your practice time becomes the healthiest, most rewarding, part of your day. Happy Laps will show you, step by step, a completely fresh way to move through the water, a way I guarantee will make swimming easier than anything you’ve tried before.Happy Laps is “Child’s Play”Kids have always had the right idea – swimming is just another form of play. In their water play, they gain an instinctive understanding of the freedom and flow that being nearly weightless offers. Adults play too little and worry too much about “getting it right” making improvement a struggle instead of a pleasure. Happy Laps is a series of thoughtfully-choreographed learning games and self-awareness exercises that will let you learn (as opposed to teaching you) how your body naturally behaves in the water, and how to become perfectly comfortable with that. Think of these exercises as structured playtime, a more organized path to learning what child’s play at your local pool would have taught you years ago. Most important, in Happy Laps there’s no “right or wrong,” just mindful movement and what you learn from it. Simply do each step with an open and curious spirit to discover how your body really behaves in the water and how to use that knowledge to advantage.Happy Laps lets you be your own best swimming teacherHappy Laps is a self-help program with no instructor or class schedule. You and a partner help each other discover the joy of swimming like a fish…anytime, anywhere it’s convenient, using the revolutionary TI Buddy System. In the Buddy System, swimmers learn in pairs. Coaching in the TI Buddy System takes no expertise at all. You only need to recognize ease and sleekness, compared to struggle and awkwardness. Compare your partner’s positions with those on the video and simply report what you observe – or gently assist their adjustments. The TI Buddy System can empower literally anyone to teach anyone else how to swim with ease, efficiency and pleasure. Two complete novices can absolutely help other effectively at every step. Here are the steps to completely satisfying swimming:Lesson One: At Home In The Water The eight exercises in Lesson One will help you develop a comfortable, trusting relationship with water, understand its properties, overcome common fears, and build confidence. You’ll let the water do what it does naturally, while you calmly experience how your body behaves in a fluid. In Lesson One, you’ll also learn how to breathe comfortably in the water and how it feels to glide short distances effortlessly.Lesson Two: Weightless In The Water The 10 Lesson Two exercises show you how to position your body and distribute your weight to get the water to support you completely and effortlessly. Your partner will become even more valuable in aiding your comfort, control and learning as you learn to float in the first four exercises. If you’re an adult and haven’t yet learned to swim comfortably, it’s not likely you can persuade your rational mind after all these years that you can get the water to support you. Here you simply do floating exercises over and over, with help from your partner, until you know “in your bones” that the water will support you every time.Lesson 3: Becoming Balanced And Slippery Having experienced the freedom of weightless, effortless movement, the eight Lesson Three exercises will teach you a swimming style that will be easy to learn so you can quickly begin gaining all the benefits and pleasures of graceful, relaxed laps. These skills will also serve as the perfect foundation for learning advanced strokes with habits of flow, efficiency and ease, rather than struggle.* * *In the Happy Laps program, you’ll be freed from the pressure to swim “right” or to go fast. Experiment with each exercise for as long as you want, repeating it as many times as you want. Your goal is not to do them correctly but to do them in a relaxed and fluid way, to turn each exercise from unfamiliar and possibly a little awkward, into smooth and easy.Learning to swim this way will also put you in a frame of mind to appreciate the value of practicing swimming in the mindful spirit of yoga and tai chi. We’ve consciously designed Total Immersion to be practiced as a “moving meditation” in the same way as yoga and tai chi. And once you begin swimming mindfully, you won’t want to swim any other way. If you thought you’d never learn to swim, Happy Laps will teach you how. We guarantee it.

Easy Freestyle: 21st Century Techniques for Beginners to Advanced Swimmers (DVD),"


Details

We have released Easy Freestyle, the latest (and likely final) update to our line of freestyle improvement videos.Terry Laughlin, TI Founder and Head Coach says:After working on Easy Freestyle since early March, I feel it represents something truly ground-breaking in “self-help swim-im-provement.” First it teaches the unmistakable advantage of: (1) minimizing energy waste before focusing on increasing fitness or power; and (2) minimizing drag first in every aspect of the stroke – including pull, kick and breathing.Second, it uses dramatically enhanced presentation tools for learning each step and answering every question, including: (1) Clear links of every lesson to the full stroke; (2) Side-by-side comparison of correct and incorrect techniques; (3) Graphic enhancements to clarify every critical position and movement path; and (4) A review/practice segment for each lesson. Here’s a lesson summary:Lesson One: Cooperate with Gravity - Learn to use – not fight – gravity to: (1) Find your natural equilibrium in the water; (2) Achieve a sense of support, comfort and confidence; and (3) Break a cycle of exhausting overkicking.Lesson Two: Take the Path of Least Resistance - Learn """"fishlike"""" body positions and hone your alignment to minimize drag through active streamlining.Lesson Three: Swim with your Body - Learn to: (1) Use your hand to “cut a path” through the water, lessening resistance for your torso and legs; and (2) Use rhythmic weight shifts - instead of fatigue-prone arms and legs - to propel yourself with effortless power.Lesson Four: The """"Perpetual Motion"""" Stroke - Learn to use your """"powerhouse"""" (core-body rotation) to drive your pull and kick. Maximal speed with minimal fatigue equals the “Perpetual Motion” Stroke.Lesson Five: Channel your Energy - Integrate a compact, relaxed recovery with core-powered movement to minimize unnecessary muscle activation, increase ease of movement, and channel energy where it does the most good.Lesson Six: Seamless Breathing - Learn breathing skills that not only get your muscles the oxygen they need, but also make your stroke more powerful and effective.Lesson Seven: Turns that save Energy and Time - Learn the secrets of a fast, easy turn. Three versions of the “touch” or “open” turn that provide more air and yet can be fast enough for racing and two versions of the flip turn. All illustrated as comprehensively as every other skill.Lesson Eight: Swim Faster Efficiently - Swim fast the smart way instead of the hard way. Learn to increase stroke tempo in a controlled and incremental way without sacrificing the efficiency you’ve patiently developed, with the aid of a Speed Trainer.

Extraordinary Swimming for Every Body: A guide to swimming better than you ever imagined (Book),"


Details

Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning “Continuous Improvement.” The defining characteristic of the most successful and satisfied TI Swimmers is, ironically, that they’re never satisfied. They believe they can continue learning and improving for life. Kaizen Swimming – how and why – is the theme of our latest book, Extraordinary Swimming for Every Body which is also the most complete and current summary of how to swim your best the TI Way.At age 55, Terry Laughlin broke two National Masters records and was named the All-American for Long Distance Swimming in his age group, despite the fact that his first 10 years of competitive swimming - from age 12 to 22 – gave no hint of inborn talent for swimming well. Terry has improved more since age 50 than at any other time in his life. In ES4EB he shares all the lessons drawn from a lifetime of striving to swim well. The primary lesson is that the “secret” to extraordinary accomplishment is no secret at all, but is contained in behaviors, habits and attitudes that can be learned by anyone.ES4EB is for: (1) those who wish to advance beyond TI basics toward the highest levels of skill and mastery; (2) those interested in becoming “complete” swimmers; or (3) competitive swimmers of any age – especially Masters swimmers. It includes our most up-to-date guidance on how to develop and train all four strokes. This book would also be the essential TI text for swimming coaches and teachers and those interested in becoming TI coaches.

HydroSpeed 2 Female Race John:Specialized female cut extends from neck to knee Open back design Available in Sizes 24-36 A New Evolution of HydroSpeed: HydroSpeed suits use specific water repellant and iso-panel characteristics to allow the athlete to perform at the highest level of competition. HydroSpeed suits are also built with tougher fabric and stitching, making it more durable than other similar racing suits on the market. HydroSpeed Technology: HydroSpeed 2 is the fusion of water and performance. The FINIS Development team has elevated the original HydroSpeed line and created a new racing suit with three unique elements:  Water-Repellency - In order to reduce the overall drag coefficient in the water, HydroSpeed 2 fabric is comprised of a light-weight, hollow-core SCALEX material, which allows for less water absorption. The embossed, scale-like finish deflects and whisks away water from the body. The suit effectively turns the body into a hydro-dynamic torpedo, with reduced drag and increased speed. Smart Compression - The hollow-core Scalex material provides a comfortable compression against the body. The engineered fabric holds and presses muscle groups effectively, without squeezing and restricting muscle movement. Further, each suit is comprised of several different iso-panels that target specific compression levels for different muscle groups. By isolating and slightly pressing against the muscles, lactic acid levels are reduced and nerve senses are heighted The result allows athletes to be more aware of their body position and technique, swim more effectively at higher speeds and longer distances, and ultimately increase overall performance. Durability - Knowing that Swimmers have multiple races in a season, the FINIS development team wanted to design the suit to last longer than other similar championship suits. By utilizing a stronger, double-layer fabric and secure flat-lock stitches, the HydroSpeed 2 suits guarantee durability without having to increase the overall weight of the suit. Each HydroSpeed 2 suit comes with a 30 day warranty from FINIS.

Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS Watch With Heart Rate Strap,"


Details

There’s a coach in every watch. The touchscreen Forerunner® 620 GPS running watch offers recovery advisor and VO2 max estimate and has connected features like automatic uploads to Garmin Connect™.

Top Features of the Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS Watch
Touchscreen GPS running watch with high-resolution color display that tracks distance, pace and heart rateCalculates your recovery time and VO₂ max estimate when used with heart rateHRM-Run monitor adds data for cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillationConnected features: automatic uploads to Garmin Connect™, live tracking, social media sharingCompatible with free training plans from Garmin Connect

It’s the next best thing to having your own personal running coach. Forerunner® 620 offers advanced features like recovery advisor, race predictor and VO₂ max estimate to help you train smarter and achieve new race goals. When used with the HRM-Run monitor, the 620 also provides feedback on running form by showing your cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillation. For indoor training, the 620’s built-in accelerometer tracks distance, so you don’t need a separate foot pod.It Knows Your PotentialRegardless of how long you’ve been running, you likely want to know how you can improve and objectively measure your fitness. Forerunner® 620 does just that by estimating your VO₂ max, which is a good indicator of athletic capability. Previously, the only way to know your VO₂ max was by paying for a lab test. When used with a heart rate monitor, the 620 crunches several pieces of data, like your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate your VO₂ max. The number itself indicates the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute, per kilogram of body weight at your max performance.A color gauge on the watch shows how your VO₂ max data compares to other runners of your gender and age range. Based on your VO₂ max estimate, the 620 can predict your race times for several distances. This can give you a time target for your next race, assuming you’ve completed proper training.Rest Day or Run DayForerunner® 620 takes out the guesswork when it comes to planning your recovery time between hard workouts. Just like a coach, it learns you and your physiology based on your heart rate data, so it factors this against your last workout and then shows how much time before you are fully recovered and ready for your next hard running workout.When wearing HRM-Run, the 620 provides a recovery check, which is a real-time indication of your state of recovery within the first several minutes of your run. When you’ve completed a run, the recovery time shows how long before you should attempt another hard workout. Color coding on the gauge makes it easy to interpret — green means you’re good to go. When you see red and a recovery time of more than 3 days, you might consider taking a rest day or just doing a light recovery run. Following Your FormThe 620 is the first GPS running watch that provides feedback on your running form by reporting multiple metrics. When used with the HRM-Run monitor, the 620 reports your cadence, vertical oscillation and ground contact time. These metrics are called running dynamics, and they impact your running economy.The HRM-Run has an accelerometer, which measures your torso movement as you run in order to compute these metrics. Cadence is the total number of steps you take per minute, left and right foot combined. Vertical oscillation is the degree of “bounce” in your running motion, measured in centimeters. Ground contact time is just like it sounds — the amount of time your foot spends on the ground during each running step, measured in milliseconds. A color gauge makes it easy to see how your running dynamics compare to other runners.Get ConnectedThanks to its wireless upload capabilities, Forerunner® 620 can send your run data to our online community, Garmin Connect, without being connected to a computer. It can transfer the data through the Garmin Connect™ Mobile app on your smartphone.

Top Features of the Garmin Forerunner 220 GPS Watch
GPS running watch with high-resolution color displayTracks distance, pace and heart rate¹Identifies personal recordsConnected features²: automatic uploads to Garmin Connect™, live tracking, social media sharingCompatible with free training plans from Garmin Connect

Just like a coach, Forerunner® 220 provides the motivating feedback you need to guide your training. You can even get post-run encouragement from friends and fans, thanks to the 220’s connected features like real-time live tracking and social media sharing via the Garmin Connect Mobile™ app.A Coach in Every WatchForerunner® 220 measures essential running data like distance, pace and heart rate¹. It’s like having a coach on hand, providing constant feedback and recording all your stats so you can focus on your run. In addition to using GPS to calculate distance and pace, the 220 has a built-in accelerometer. This allows it to capture distance and pace data when you’re running on an indoor track or treadmill, with no need for a separate foot pod accessory. The accelerometer can also track distance when GPS is unavailable, such as when you run through a tunnel. It’s compatible with free training plans from Garmin Connect™, which you can schedule and send to your watch, for real-time coaching.Easy to UseThe 220 is one of the first Garmin running watches to have a color display, which makes it easy to interpret your data at a glance. It also features simple button operations and a sturdy, hinged wristband that’s comfortable for any size wrist.Extra Training FeaturesYou can set up alerts for heart rate, pace or run/walk intervals to help you stay in the desired range. The 220 features vibration alerts and audible alerts, and you can customize your watch to provide both or just one type of prompt. When your run’s done and saved in your watch’s history, a post-run summary appears so you can see how you did. The 220 also notices if you hit any personal records on that run, like your fastest kilometer, 5k, 10k, half or full marathon or your longest run to date. Get ConnectedIf you’re like most runners, you want to analyze your stats after your run or race, but you may not be back at your computer right away. Forerunner® 220 solves that by automatically uploading your data to Garmin Connect, our free online community where you can save, plan and share your activities. Just download the free Garmin Connect Mobile app to your smartphone and then pair your watch. When you save your completed run, it will automatically upload to Garmin Connect when you’re in range of your phone.Additional connected features include live tracking, which allows your friends and fans to follow along and see your stats in real-time. You must have your phone paired with the 220 throughout your run to use the LiveTrack feature. You can also share your victories on your social media sites by posting updates through the Garmin Connect Mobile app. And, for real-time coaching as you run, the 220 is compatible with free training plans at Garmin Connect.

Fits On Your Glove
Attaches easily to almost any golf glove. Simply slide the velcro strap on your glove through the rubber ""belts""on the back of GolfSense and you're all set. Unlike other products that require you to strap devices onto each club before you swing, GolfSense conveniently rests on the back of your glove always ready to go.

Ultra Lightweight
While it's packed with technology and innovation, GolfSense weighs in at just 0.6 oz (17 grams). It's so light that most people forget it's even on their glove.
Revolutionary Mobile Applications
GolfSense can detect the acceleration, velocity, tempo, position and posture of the device and the club by calculating sensor data at sample rates over 1,000 times per second. At the same time, the high velocity motion engine inside the software will divide the swing into different segments of club position and posture. The result is a highly accurate view of your swing down to the millisecond.
When it comes to calculating club head speed, GolfSense is within 3 mph of doppler radar systems such as TrackMan and laser systems such as GolfAchiever.
The GolfSense App is available for iPhone, iPod, iPad and Android mobile devices.

In-Depth Swing Analysis
The GolfSense app is driven by a powerful motion engine that delivers in-depth analysis of your golf swing presented in a clear, easy to use interface. Important information about each aspect of your swing, from your backswing all the way to the speed of your wrist rotation and everything in between, GolfSense provides the most comprehensive feedback of any golf swing analyzer on the market today.
 3D Motion Capture - How it Works
GolfSense is the world's first portable three dimensional sensor system designed to deliver real-time feedback and analysis of your golf swing. The patented high velocity motion engine uses data from 4 discrete MEMS sensors inside the device to accurately calculate club speed, club position, swing tempo, and swing path. The revolutionary and free mobile app allows you to analyze each segment of your swing from any angle. Review any single swing, or compare two separate swings at once within the application. GolfSense is not only a product, but it's a platform that will soon allow you to compare your swings to many others including professionals and coaches. Simply connect GolfSense to your mobile device via bluetooth, and let the fun begin. The application can be set to automatically capture and save every swing in rapid succession or just the ones you select with a simple press of the yellow button. Turn on ""impact detection"" and GolfSense will ignore your practice swings and only log those that pertain to actual ball contact. It's easy, fun, automatic, and awesome! Review any single swing, or compare two separate swings at once within the application. GolfSense is not only a product, but it's a platform that will soon allow you to compare your swings to many others including professionals and coaches.
Swing Guidance and Recommendations
Is your backswing too slow? Are you hitting the ball too early or decelerating before impact? As part of your golf swing analysis, GolfSense displays helpful recommendations, letting you know how you can modify your swing to improve your technique. With your swing history recorded, you'll be able to chart your progress over time as you work on improving each part of your swing.

Cloud Sync Multi-Device Sharing
Using GolfSense Cloud Sync technology, your swing history is easily accessible on any iOS or Android enabled device. By logging into your user account, you'll be able to sync your history to the cloud via any wireless or mobile data connection. You'll then be able to retrieve your data from any other wireless device where you have downloaded the GolfSense application. Now you can take your iPhone or Galaxy phone to the course to record your data and view your analysis later on the larger screen of your iPad.

FAQ:
How does iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor work? The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor is a fully automatic arm cuff blood pressure monitor that uses the oscillometric principle to measure your systolic, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. The monitor works with the free iHealth MyVitals app that has personalized health tools to help you get the most out of your data and to better manage your health goal.

You can log in to the cloud from anywhere and anytime to access your data, regardless of where the measurement was taken. Can the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor be used with more than one iPhone, iPad or iPod touch?

Fitbit Aria | Wi-Fi Smart Scale,"


Details


Outsmart your weight with Aria™.
ARIA™ WI-FI SMART SCALE
Get where you want to be. Aria™ tracks your weight, body fat percentage, and BMI, painting a picture of your long-term progress. It wirelessly syncs your stats with online graph and mobile tools that help you stay motivated and on track. When you're in control, stepping on the scale feels good.

It's one sharp scale
Like any scale, Aria™ measures your weight. That's only half the story. Aria™ also contains advanced technology to accurately assess your weight as well as your body fat % and BMI. Day after day, it helps you focus on results.

ARIA™ TRACKS:

Weight
Body fat
BMI


What's body fat percentage?
Body fat is essential to maintaining good health. For most women, 14-31% is a healthy range. For guys, that range is closer to 6-24%.
What's BMI?
BMI stands for body mass index. It looks at body fat in relation to height and weight and tells you if you're in the healthy range.
Tracks your data for you
The easy-to-read display shows you what Aria™ is tracking. It identifies you by name (or initials), then displays your weight and body fat %, letting you know when that info syncs to your account. Over time, go from fearing the unknown to feeling empowered. Even looking forward to that daily or weekly check-in.

Recognizes up to eight people (discreetly)

Set-up is simple.

Just download the Fitbit software, then link your scale to your home wireless network and you're good to go.

Invite the family.

Aria™ recognizes up to eight individual users, so you can invite the whole family.
Whenever you step on the scale, it sends your data straight to your account.
Everyone's info is private by default.

Syncs your stats through Wi-Fi

Every time you step on the scale, Aria™ automatically and wirelessly syncs your stats through your Wi-Fi network to your private Fitbit account. From there, you've got real-time access to your progress, 24/7.
Gain insights &amp; take control

Aria™ helps you focus on long-term trends, rather than short-term blips (hello, coconut cream pie). Analyze your weight, body fat %, and BMI trends with easy-to-understand graphs and charts — or keep tabs on the go with Fitbit's free mobile app. Either way, you'll gain an understanding of what drives you.




Sensors
WEIGHT AND BMI
Four load cells measure weight. BMI is calculated and displayed based on weight.
BODY COMPOSITION

The scale measures body mass using bioimpedance analysis. ITO electrodes form a pattern on the top of scale, and send a small, safe signal through the body to measure impedance.


Colors &amp; materials
Aria™ comes in two colors:

Black

Tempered glass platform
ABS bottom housing

Fitbit One | Wireless Activity & Sleep Tracker,"


Details

Get fit. Sleep better. All in the One™  
THE ONE™ WIRELESS ACTIVITY &amp; SLEEP TRACKER
If you want to turn fitness into a lifestyle, the One™ is for you. For starters, it never rests. During the day, it tracks your steps, distance, calories burned, and stairs climbed. Come nightfall, it measures your sleep quality, helps you learn how to sleep better, and wakes you in the morning. The One™ motivates you to reach your goals by bringing greater fitness into your life – seamlessly, socially, 24 hours a day.
A lot of power, a little device
Monitor your day with the One™ – this tracker’s aim is to empower and encourage you by delivering real-time feedback that helps you be more active. Why not take the stairs instead of the elevator? Or go for a quick walk after lunch? Those steps will add up fast.
The One™ Tracks:

STEPS TAKEN
Stairs climbed
Calories burned
Hours slept
Distance traveled
Quality of sleep


Powered by Fitbit’s leading-edge accelerometer and altimeter, the One™ accurately captures all-day activity that old-school pedometers can’t handle. It bases calculations like calories burned on your personal  profile – reflecting your stats, not any average Joe’s.
Helps you get your ZZZs
The One™ doesn’t nap, even when you do. Slip it into your wrist band at night, and it’ll measure your sleep quality. Once the data syncs, graphs on your dashboard will reveal how long you slept and the number of times you woke up, giving you a sleep quality score. Over time, you can apply what you learn to help you sleep more soundly. The One™ also has a silent wake alarm that gently vibrates to wake you at your desired time, without disturbing your partner.
By your side, day and night. Debuting in black and burgundy, the One™ is suitably discreet. Wear it comfortably in your pocket, on a belt, or a bra – the silicone clip will keep it secure. Use the sleep wrist band at night. Its rechargeable battery lasts five to seven days before needing a boost. The One™ is also rain, splash, and sweat-proof, allowing you to brave the elements.

Syncs your stats for you

Pool Mate HR (Waterproof Heart Rate Monitor),"


Details

Automatic swimming computer with Heart Rate and Vibrating Alarm
  Heart rate in and out of the water-  Most heart rate monitors do not work under water*. The PoolMateHR has been specially designed for swimmers so it will transmit when in the pool. View your heart rate on the watch during your swim and download afterwards for further analysis. You can also use it as a heart rate monitor out of the pool for other activities.
Automatic lap and stroke counting for each lap-  The PoolMateHR has all our swim monitoring functions including laps, strokes, speed, distance, calories, stroke length, strokes per minute and efficiency which are automatically calculated from your arm movements. In addition to the set by set information shown by the PoolMate and PoolMatePro, the PoolMateHR downloads data for each individual lap you swim.
Vibrating alarm-  Our unique vibrating alarm alerts you when you have swam a certain number of laps, distance or time interval- a really great innovation to keep track in the pool.
Tough but stylish-  The PoolMateHR has a sleek but tough design with sapphire crystal glass and a ceramic bezel so it stands up to the hardest swim session and is suitable for everyday wear too.
Downloadable and rechargeable- The PoolMateHR comes with it’s own USB pod which charges the watch and downloads the data to your computer. The battery should last a few weeks with normal use so wont need charging too often.

The vibrating alarm is such a useful tool and we think it’s one of the key features. There are several ways to use it.
1, Set it to go off every 10 laps (or any multiple of laps you like) and it will gently shake the watch so you can feel the buzz on your arm so you don’t need to look at your watch to see how many laps you have swam.
2, Set it to go off every 100m (or any distance interval) so you can feel the buzz each time you have completed this distance.
3, Set it to go off after 30 minutes (or any long time interval) so it will alert you when you have swam for your allotted time (you can also use it in chrono mode this way when doing other activities).
4, Imagine you want to swim at a pace of 90 seconds per 100m. Set the vibrate alarm to go off every 90 seconds (or any short time interval) and feel the buzz each 100m. This is a great way to keep your pace correct in a longer set. If you feel the buzz exactly at the 100m turn you know you are on track (you can use this in chrono mode too of course).
The software is simple and easy to use, you can use it with the PoolMatePro and PoolMateHR you just wont be able to see any lap by lap or heart rate data on the PoolMatePro.

Agility Paddles,"


Details

The ergonomically advanced design of the Agility Paddles helps teach swimmers the correct palm positive hand position. Due to the paddles strapless design, incorrect technique will cause the paddle to fall off the swimmer’s hand. The Agility Paddles’ convex design also promotes an early catch and reminds the swimmer to maintain an early vertical forearm position. This versatile paddle works for all four strokes and accommodates most hand sizes. Not only are the Agility Paddles durable, but the absence of straps makes them more comfortable for the swimmers and easier for coaches, who no longer have to hassle with broken straps during practice.

Garmin Forerunner 910XT | Multi-Sports GPS Watch,"


Details


You swim. You bike. You run. You obsess over data anddetails. So do we. And we’ve just perfected your new training partner.Forerunner 910XT is the only all-in-one, GPS-enabled device thatprovides detailed swim metrics and tracks distance, pace, elevation andheart rate¹ for running and cycling. It sports a sleek profile, comfywristband and an easy-to-read display.
Dive In
 
Designed for open water and pool swimming, Forerunner 910XT is waterresistant to 50 m (164 ft). It’s our first multisport watch to offerextensive swim metrics, including swim distance, stroke identification,stroke count and pool lengths. It also computes your swolf score to helpyou gauge your swimming efficiency. The 910XT’s robust design and easyoperations make it suited for other water sports, including paddleboarding.
Because it’s GPS-enabled, Forerunner 910XT even captures the path youtraveled so you can view it later on a map in our free onlinecommunity, Garmin Connect™. This feature can help you analyze your open water swimming and adjust your technique as needed.
Transition Seamlessly
Whether you’re training or racing, every second counts, so the 910XTmakes it easy and seamless to transition between sports. The automultisport feature lets you switch sport modes with just 1 button press,so you don’t lose precious seconds in transition. The optional quick release mount allows you to move the 910XT easily from wrist to bike.
Try It Dry
On land, Forerunner 910XT offers many of the features of our advancedcycling computers and sport watches to accurately capture your time,distance, speed or pace. The 910XT is our first multisport device toincorporate a barometric altimeter for highly accurate elevation data,including ascent, descent and grade. Configurable data fields let youcustomize multiple training pages for each sport. Set up vibrationalerts to give a silent nudge when you hit a split, when it’s time totake nutrition or if you need a little feedback to stay within range ofyour goals. With these high-level features and up to 20 hours of batterylife, the 910XT is ideal for athletes training for ultras or irondistance tris.
Take It to the Next Level
For advanced training, the 910XT is compatible with ANT+™ sensors,including the optional speed/cadence sensor for cycling or premium heartrate monitor (included with some models).You can pair the 910XT with an existing ANT+ heart rate monitor orpurchase as an accessory. Track your weight, body fat, body water and 6other measurements when using the 910XT with the Tanita BC-1000 body composition scale. The readings are stored on Forerunner 910XT,then automatically sent to Garmin Connect when in range of yourcomputer.
And for those data-driven athletes, the 910XT also is compatible with ANT+ power meters, such as Vector™, our pedal-based power meter.
Plan, Analyze and Share
Make the most of every workout by uploading to Garmin Connect.Here, you can see your activity on a map and view detailed metrics. Youalso can use Connect to plan new routes, create and schedule customworkouts and explore activities from other users. Through the magic ofANT+ wireless technology and the tiny USB stick that comes with your910XT, your workout data automatically transfers to your computer whenin range. Garmin Connect is Mac® and Windows® compatible.
¹Although heart rate monitor may be worn in water, it will not transmit heart rate data while submerged.

What is it?

Your Wahoo Fitness Blue HR Heart Rate Strap is a device worn inproximity to the heart that gathers electrical activity data to deriveyour heart beats per minute.

 How do I use it?

Thoroughly wet both electrodes on the Strap with water or electrodegel. It is important that the electrodes are sufficiently moist so that agood skin-toelectrode connection is made.
Snap one end of the Strap to one side of the Pod. Either end of theStrap can connect to either end of the Pod, but the Pod should have theWahoo Fitness logo facing up when in use.
Wrap the Strap around your back and snap the free end to the freeside of the Pod so that the Pod is located on your breastplate, justbelow your breasts. Adjust the Strap to create a snug, yet comfortablefit.
Once in place, move within 5’ - 10’ of any device that receives Bluetooth Smart wireless data, such as the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5.

How do I pair my Blue HR using the Wahoo Fitness App?

Open the Wahoo Fitness App
Tap the wrench icon in the top right for settings
Choose Workout Settings
Select the Workout Type
Choose Add Sensor
Select HR
It should start searching for the HR. You might also see the BT logo flash.
Click Save in the top right

It won't connect! What do I do?

If you do not get a reading, or the readings are erroneous, ensurethat the electrodes are wet, have good contact with your skin and thethat your Heart Rate Sensor is sufficiently snug. Your Heart Rate Sensor‘sleeps’ with inactivity and ‘awakens’ with good electical contact. Abrief physical warm up may be required.

How do I pair it with my device?

Each Sensor has a unique identification code and can be uniquelyparied with a display device or reader so that it will always berecognized when it is activated and within range. Since each reader isunique, you should reference the instructions of your reader for pairingtechniques.
Make sure the Bluetooth setting on your device is turned on and that you have latest version of your favorite compatible app. 
Pair the heart rate strap in the app, not in Bluetooth settings. In the wahoo app, it is under quick settings and then either pairnew sensor (if you don't have a paired hr strap yet) or heart rate. You can pair the strap there.

How do I change the battery?

The battery is located behind a cover on the back of your Heart RateSensor Pod and can be replaced by placing a coin in the slot andturning the cover 1/4 turn counterclockwise. Replace with a 3 voltCR2032 battery (contact a local waste handling group for proper disposalof old battery).

Bone Conduction
As humans, we are able to detect sound vibrations through the air via our eardrums (Air Conduction) or through our bones directly into our inner ear (Bone Conduction). Because there is no air under the water, Bone Conduction is the best way to hear audio while swimming.
The speakers of the Neptune sit on the cheek, just in front of the ear. These speakers vibrate the jaw bones and send vibrations to the inner-ear or Cochlea. The result is an amazing audio experience that makes it feel as if the music is playing inside your head. The ears are free and clear, and there are no earbuds to mess with.
Bone Conduction is a safe and proven method of sound transmission that has been used in phone headsets and hearing aids. In fact, Bone Conduction audio is used by whales and dolphins to listen to one another underwater.

Bar Fly 1.1 (By Tate Labs) | Bike Mount For Garmin Forerunner & Edge Computers,"


Details

We introduced the Bar Fly mounting system and revolutionized the perception of how a cycling computer should be attached to a bicycle. This perception has created a shift in thinking and with it we have seen the demand expose many different needs of athletes and recreational cyclists. At Tate Labs we’ve always envisioned one mount that would function flawlessly to serve the needs of multiple user groups. The introduction of the Bar Fly 1.1 enables an interface for each of those user groups whether they are recreationalist, mountain bikers, road cyclist, triathletes, or cycle-cross riders. You could say we were interested in versatility, but truth be told, we’re more interested in simplicity and functionality.


Function
At the heart of the Bar Fly 1.1 is 1/8th turn technology and it’s the center point of our new mounting system. The 1/8th turn mechanism is a patent pending positive engagement system that enables cross compatibility with all Garmin Edge series cycling computers, and the Garmin Forerunner 910 XT and 310 XT watches. With Bar Fly 1.1 transitioning between multiple computers from dirt to pavement and run to bike has never been this easy. Stay centered on all your bikes with Bar Fly 1.1.
Made in the USA out of Delrin with no screws to lose, Bar Fly 1.1 is the only mount that positions all of your Garmin devices directly in the center of the handlebar in a safe and aesthetic viewing position. 
Specifications
For use on 31.8 mm diameter Handlebars
Bar Fly 1.1 is compatible with the following Garmin computers:

Forerunner 910 XT and 310 XT watches*
All Edge series cycling computers, including the 200, 500, and 800.* requires the use of the Garmin Forerunner Quick Release Kit sold separately.

 Installation:

Remove the bolt with a 3 mm allen key. This will eliminate the risk of scratching your nice handlebars.
Gently open the mount to fit around the handle bar.
Re-install the bolt and tighten until snug by hand.
