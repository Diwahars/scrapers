<h2><span style=""color: #000000;"">FAQ:</span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>How does the iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale work?</strong> <br> iHealth Wireless Body Analysis uses four electronic sensors, as well as a set of                             proprietary algorithms to measure body composition. By standing still on these sensors                             with bare feet, the scale can accurately measure 9 different body components. Data                             is displayed on the scale, and automatically sent wirelessly to the free iHealth                             MyVitals app, which has personalized health tools to help you get the most out of                             your data and to better manage your health goal.<br> <br> <strong>What does the iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale measure?</strong><br> The iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale measures 9 different components including                             body weight, body fat, lean mass, muscle mass, bone mass, body water, daily calorie                             intake (DCI), and visceral fat rating.<br> <br> <strong>How accurate is the iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale?</strong><br> The iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale is a FDA and CE approved device. It meets                             the rigorous accuracy standards set by the governing bodies in the USA and Europe.<br> <br> <strong>Can children use iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale? </strong> <br> The iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale is designed for adults. Infants or young                             children or any person who cannot stand still without assistance should not use                             it.                             <br> <br> <strong>Can people with heart disease use the iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale? </strong> <br> Yes, however, people with pacemakers should not use the scale due to electrical                             interference. <br><br> <strong>What is body composition? </strong> <br> In physical fitness, body composition is used to describe the percentages of fat,                             bone and muscle in human bodies. Because muscular tissue takes up less space in                             our body than fat tissue, our body composition—as well as our weight—determines                             leanness.                             <br><br> <strong>How many users can iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale support?</strong><br> The scale can accommodate up to 20 users and  store up to 200 measurements for each user. When each user’s memory is  full, any new measurements will overwrite the oldest ones. The scale is  an ideal tool for families, fitness clubs and sports teams.                              <br><br> <strong>Can the iHealth Wireless Body Analysis Scale be used without an iOS device? </strong> <br> Yes. The scale can be used without an iOS device after the first connection is established.                             However it may be necessary to use your iOS device (launch the app) at least once                             every 200 weigh-ins, as new measurements overwrite older ones stored in the Scale.                             When the Wi-Fi connection is re-established measurement data will be uploaded to                             your iOS device                             <br><br> <strong>What is iHealth Cloud and how to access it? </strong> <br> Upon setting up your app user account, you will also have access to a free, secure                             iHealth cloud service account where all of your data is backed up and stored securely.                             Go to www.ihealthlabs.com, then click on ""Sign in"" to access your cloud service                             account using your app login name and password. You can log in to the cloud from                             anywhere and anytime to access your data, regardless of where the measurement was                             taken.</span></p>

<p><strong>How does the Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor work? </strong> <br> The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist  Monitor is a fully automatic arm cuff blood pressure monitor that uses  the oscillometric principle to measure your systolic, diastolic blood  pressure and pulse rate. The monitor works with the free iHealth  MyVitals app that has personalized health tools to help you get the most  out of your data and to better manage your health goal. <br> <br> <strong>What is motion sensor technology?</strong><br> Wrist blood monitor is sensitive to the wrist  position. The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor features a  motion sensor technology to detect the optimal wrist position to help  users take their blood pressure reading correctly.  <br> <br> <strong>How accurate is the iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor?</strong><br> The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist  Monitor has obtained CE medical certification (Europe) as well as FDA  approval (USA). The monitor also has obtained ESH Certification  (European Society of Hypertension).<br> <br> <strong>Why home monitoring is a great way to track blood pressure?</strong><br> Home monitoring is a great way to help detect  and monitor high blood pressure. Regular readings taken over a period  of time can track the history of your results and indicate any changes,  fluctuations or elevations in your blood pressure. An individual high  reading is not necessarily an indication of hypertension or other health  issue. iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor provides a  convenient way to test, track and share your results.<br> <br> <strong>What is iHealth Cloud and how to access it?</strong><br> Upon setting up your app user account, you  will also have access to a free, secure iHealth cloud service account  where all of your data is backed up and stored securely. Go to  www.ihealthlabs.com, then click on ""Sign in"" to access your cloud  service account using your app login name and password. You can log in  to the cloud from anywhere and anytime to access your data, regardless  of where the measurement was taken.<br> <br> <strong>Can the Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor be used with more than one iPhone, iPad or iPod touch?</strong><br> Yes, you can use the Blood Pressure Monitor  with as many different iPhones, iPads or iPod touches as you wish. Just  install the iHealth MyVitals app on each device you intend to use with  the monitor. <br> <br> <strong>Can I set up the app so multiple users can use the Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor?</strong><br> Yes. You can set up multiple accounts in the  iHealth MyVitals app. Then choose the desired user before each reading.<br> <br> <strong>Can measurements be taken without an iOS device?</strong><br> Yes. You can enable the offline measurement  in the “Device Settings” of iHealth MyVitals app. To start measurements  when disconnected from the iOS device (“offline”), turn on the Monitor  by pressing the “START/STOP”button. Offline measurement data will be  uploaded to the device automatically upon the next iOS connection.</p>

<div id=""built-to-keep-div"">
<h2>It's one sharp scale</h2>
<p>Like any scale, Aria™ measures your weight. That's only half the story. Aria™ also contains advanced technology to accurately assess your weight as well as your body fat % and BMI. Day after day, it helps you focus on results.</p>
</div>
<div id=""built-to-keep-div2""><span>ARIA™ TRACKS:</span>
<ul>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Body fat</li>
<li>BMI</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>What's body fat percentage?</h3>
<p>Body fat is essential to maintaining good health. For most women, 14-31% is a healthy range. For guys, that range is closer to 6-24%.</p>
<h3>What's BMI?</h3>
<p>BMI stands for body mass index. It looks at body fat in relation to height and weight and tells you if you're in the healthy range.</p>
<h3 id=""h2"">Tracks your data for you</h3>
<div id=""text-bottom"">The easy-to-read display shows you what Aria™ is tracking. It identifies you by name (or initials), then displays your weight and body fat %, letting you know when that info syncs to your account. Over time, go from fearing the unknown to feeling empowered. Even looking forward to that daily or weekly <span class=""nowrap"">check-in.</span></div>
<div><br>
<h2>Recognizes up to eight people (discreetly)</h2>
<div class=""text"">
<h3>Set-up is simple.</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Invite the family.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aria™ recognizes up to eight individual users, so you can invite the whole family.</li>
<li>Whenever you step on the scale, it sends your data straight to your account.</li>
<li>Everyone's info is private by default.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syncs your stats through Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>Every time you step on the scale, Aria™ automatically and wirelessly syncs your stats through your Wi-Fi network to your private Fitbit account. From there, you've got real-time access to your progress, 24/7.</p>
<h2>Gain insights &amp; take control</h2>
<div class=""text"">
<p>Aria™ helps you focus on long-term trends, rather than short-term blips (hello, coconut cream pie). Analyze your weight, body fat %, and BMI trends with<br> easy-to-understand graphs and charts — or keep tabs on the go with Fitbit's free mobile app. Either way, you'll gain an understanding of what drives you.</p>

<h2><span class=""sub-title"">THE ONE™ WIRELESS ACTIVITY &amp; SLEEP TRACKER</span></h2>
<p>If you want to turn fitness into a lifestyle, the One™ is for you. For starters, it never rests. During the day, it tracks your steps, distance, calories burned, and stairs climbed. Come nightfall, it measures your sleep quality, helps you learn how to sleep better, and wakes you in the morning. The One™ motivates you to reach your goals by bringing greater fitness into your life – seamlessly, socially, 24 hours a day.</p>
<h2>A lot of power, a little device</h2>
<p>Monitor your day with the One™ – this tracker’s aim is to empower and encourage you by delivering real-time feedback that helps you be more active. Why not take the stairs instead of the elevator? Or go for a quick walk after lunch? Those steps will add up fast.</p>
<div class=""text-mov lazyload"" style=""visibility: visible; display: block; background-image: url('http://static1.fitbit.com/simple.b-dis-png.h87fb6bac8add544612b9801230df5fd1.pack?items=%2Fcontent%2Fassets%2Fonezip%2Fimages%2Ffeatures-content%2Fone%2Fbox-movies.png');""><span>The One™ Tracks:</span>

<li>Stairs climbed</li>
<li>Calories burned</li>
<li>Hours slept</li>
<li>Distance traveled</li>
<li>Quality of sleep</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Powered by Fitbit’s leading-edge accelerometer and altimeter, the One™ accurately captures all-day activity that old-school pedometers can’t handle. It bases calculations like calories burned on your personal  profile – reflecting your stats, not any average Joe’s.</p>
<h2>Helps you get your ZZZs</h2>
<p>The One™ doesn’t nap, even when you do. Slip it into your wrist band at night, and it’ll measure your sleep quality. Once the data syncs, graphs on your dashboard will reveal how long you slept and the number of times you woke up, giving you a sleep quality score. Over time, you can apply what you learn to help you sleep more soundly. The One™ also has a silent wake alarm that gently vibrates to wake you at your desired time, without disturbing your partner.</p>
<div id=""text-bottom"">By your side, day and night. Debuting in black and burgundy, the One™ is suitably discreet. Wear it comfortably in your pocket, on a belt, or a bra – the silicone clip will keep it secure. Use the sleep wrist band at night. Its rechargeable battery lasts five to seven days before needing a boost. The One™ is also rain, splash, and sweat-proof, allowing you to brave the elements.</div>
<div>
<h2>Syncs your stats for you</h2>
<p>The One™ automatically syncs your data to PCs, Macs, the iPhone 4S &amp; 5, iPad 3, Retina &amp; mini, iPod touch, and select Android phones. All you need to do is sign up for your free account on Fitbit.com andregister your device (which you can also do via select smartphones). After that, voilà. Your stats will syncon their own, giving you real-time access to all that outstanding data on your Fitbit dashboard.</p>
<h2>Paints a picture of your health</h2>
<p>Fitbit is full of graphs, charts, and tools designed to help you track your progress and understand your health and fitness. The customizable dashboard and mobile app (both free) bring all that digestible data to your fingertips. Knowing how close you are to reaching your goals gives you added incentive to achieve them, sleep better, and aim higher.</p>

        <p><strong>Z2 Fin </strong></p>
<p>By dramatically improving efficiency, swimmers are able to push the limits in their training. The new Zoomer Z2 swim fins are specially designed to improve the effectiveness of one's swim workouts by creating an easier kicking movement. The channel on the bottom of the Zoomer Z2 captures water to provide ideal propulsion for longer distances, while the back ridges strengthen the hamstrings and glutes.<br>
<br>
Like the original Zoomer fins, the Zoomer Z2 fins are shorter in length than standard swim fins. They utilize a patented angle and quick response technology to promote a shorter, faster kick that makes the legs work harder while reducing the occurrence of burnout.</p>
<p><strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong></p>
<p><u>Patented Short-Blade Construction:</u><br>
Promotes a small, fast kick while increasing proper leg strength. <br>
<br>
<u>Fluid Separator:</u><br>
Creates a 'natural extension of the foot' so that the foot can slice through the water with ease. <br>
<br>
<u>Channel Convertors:</u><br>
Catch water so the swimmer can drive the legs and work the kick in both directions for maximum propulsion. <br>
<br>
<u>Closed Heel, Light-Weight Design:</u><br>
Provides comfort and security, allowing the swimmer to stay more active throughout the entire workout.</p>

Here’s a lesson summary:<br> <br> Lesson One: Cooperate with Gravity - Learn to use – not fight – gravity to: (1) Find your natural equilibrium in the water; (2) Achieve a sense of support, comfort and confidence; and (3) Break a cycle of exhausting overkicking.<br> <br> Lesson Two: Take the Path of Least Resistance - Learn """"fishlike"""" body positions and hone your alignment to minimize drag through active streamlining.<br> <br> Lesson Three: Swim with your Body - Learn to: (1) Use your hand to “cut a path” through the water, lessening resistance for your torso and legs; and (2) Use rhythmic weight shifts - instead of fatigue-prone arms and legs - to propel yourself with effortless power.<br> <br> Lesson Four: The """"Perpetual Motion"""" Stroke - Learn to use your """"powerhouse"""" (core-body rotation) to drive your pull and kick. Maximal speed with minimal fatigue equals the “Perpetual Motion” Stroke.<br> <br> Lesson Five: Channel your Energy - Integrate a compact, relaxed recovery with core-powered movement to minimize unnecessary muscle activation, increase ease of movement, and channel energy where it does the most good.<br> <br> Lesson Six: Seamless Breathing - Learn breathing skills that not only get your muscles the oxygen they need, but also make your stroke more powerful and effective.<br> <br> Lesson Seven: Turns that save Energy and Time - Learn the secrets of a fast, easy turn. Three versions of the “touch” or “open” turn that provide more air and yet can be fast enough for racing and two versions of the flip turn. All illustrated as comprehensively as every other skill.<br> <br> Lesson Eight: Swim Faster Efficiently - Swim fast the smart way instead of the hard way.

In their water play, they gain an instinctive understanding of the freedom and flow that being nearly weightless offers. Adults play too little and worry too much about “getting it right” making improvement a struggle instead of a pleasure. <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> is a series of thoughtfully-choreographed learning games and self-awareness exercises that will let you learn (as opposed to teaching you) how your body naturally behaves in the water, and how to become perfectly comfortable with that. Think of these exercises as structured playtime, a more organized path to learning what child’s play at your local pool would have taught you years ago. Most important, in <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> there’s no “right or wrong,” just mindful movement and what you learn from it. Simply do each step with an open and curious spirit to discover how your body really behaves in the water and how to use that knowledge to advantage.<br> <br> <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> lets you be your own best swimming teacher<br> <br> <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> is a self-help program with no instructor or class schedule. You and a partner help each other discover the joy of swimming like a fish…anytime, anywhere it’s convenient, using the revolutionary TI Buddy System. In the Buddy System, swimmers learn in pairs. Coaching in the TI Buddy System takes no expertise at all. You only need to recognize ease and sleekness, compared to struggle and awkwardness. Compare your partner’s positions with those on the video and simply report what you observe – or gently assist their adjustments. The TI Buddy System can empower literally anyone to teach anyone else how to swim with ease, efficiency and pleasure. Two complete novices can absolutely help other effectively at every step. Here are the steps to completely satisfying swimming:<br> <br> Lesson One: At Home In The Water<br> The eight exercises in Lesson One will help you develop a comfortable, trusting relationship with water, understand its properties, overcome common fears, and build confidence. You’ll let the water do what it does naturally, while you calmly experience how your body behaves in a fluid. In Lesson One, you’ll also learn how to breathe comfortably in the water and how it feels to glide short distances effortlessly.<br> <br> Lesson Two: Weightless In The Water<br> The 10 Lesson Two exercises show you how to position your body and distribute your weight to get the water to support you completely and effortlessly. Your partner will become even more valuable in aiding your comfort, control and learning as you learn to float in the first four exercises. If you’re an adult and haven’t yet learned to swim comfortably, it’s not likely you can persuade your rational mind after all these years that you can get the water to support you. Here you simply do floating exercises over and over, with help from your partner, until you know “in your bones” that the water will support you every time.<br> <br> Lesson 3: Becoming Balanced And Slippery<br> Having experienced the freedom of weightless, effortless movement, the eight Lesson Three exercises will teach you a swimming style that will be easy to learn so you can quickly begin gaining all the benefits and pleasures of graceful, relaxed laps. These skills will also serve as the perfect foundation for learning advanced strokes with habits of flow, efficiency and ease, rather than struggle.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> In the <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> program, you’ll be freed from the pressure to swim “right” or to go fast. Experiment with each exercise for as long as you want, repeating it as many times as you want. Your goal is not to do them correctly but to do them in a relaxed and fluid way, to turn each exercise from unfamiliar and possibly a little awkward, into smooth and easy.<br> <br> Learning to swim this way will also put you in a frame of mind to appreciate the value of practicing swimming in the mindful spirit of yoga and tai chi. We’ve consciously designed Total Immersion to be practiced as a “moving meditation” in the same way as yoga and tai chi. And once you begin swimming mindfully, you won’t want to swim any other way. If you thought you’d never learn to swim, <span style="""" font-style: italic>Happy Laps</span> will teach you how. We guarantee it.</div></div></div>     </div>

        <p><strong>HydroSpeed 2 Male Jammer:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Specialized male cut extends from waist to knee</li>
    <li>Drawstring around waist</li>
    <li>Available in Sizes 24-36</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<p><strong>A New Evolution of HydroSpeed:</strong></p>
<p>HydroSpeed suits use specific water repellant and iso-panel characteristics to allow the athlete to perform at the highest level of competition. HydroSpeed suits are also built with tougher fabric and stitching, making it more durable than other similar racing suits on the market.</p>
<p><strong>HydroSpeed Technology:</strong></p>
<p>HydroSpeed 2 is the fusion of water and performance. The FINIS Development team has elevated the original HydroSpeed line and created a new racing suit with three unique elements:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Water-Repellency</b> - In order to reduce the overall drag coefficient in the water, HydroSpeed 2 fabric is comprised of a light-weight, hollow-core SCALEX material, which allows for less water absorption. The embossed, scale-like finish deflects and whisks away water from the body. The suit effectively turns the body into a hydro-dynamic torpedo, with reduced drag and increased speed.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><b>Smart Compression</b> - The hollow-core Scalex material provides a comfortable compression against the body. The engineered fabric holds and presses muscle groups effectively, without squeezing and restricting muscle movement. Further, each suit is comprised of several different iso-panels that target specific compression levels for different muscle groups. By isolating and slightly pressing against the muscles, lactic acid levels are reduced and nerve senses are heighted The result allows athletes to be more aware of their body position and technique, swim more effectively at higher speeds and longer distances, and ultimately increase overall performance.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><b>Durability</b> - Knowing that Swimmers have multiple races in a season, the FINIS development team wanted to design the suit to last longer than other similar championship suits. By utilizing a stronger, double-layer fabric and secure flat-lock stitches, the HydroSpeed 2 suits guarantee durability without having to increase the overall weight of the suit. Each HydroSpeed 2 suit comes with a 30 day warranty from FINIS.</li>

        <p><strong>Freestyler Hand Paddle </strong></p> <p>The Freestyler Paddle is a patented hand paddle designed to improve technique specifically for the freestyle stroke. Unlike previous generations of hand paddles, the Freestyler is not designed for resistance and strength training, but applies a hydrodynamic shape to decrease resistance through the water, thereby improving reach and distance per stroke.<br> <br> The Freestyler's unique shape and 'skeg' design forces streamlined hand entry which lengthens each arm stroke. A longer stroke creates a better pull through, a better hip-rotation, and ultimately increases performance.</p> <p><strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong></p> <p><u>Small, Streamlined Shape:</u><br> Decreases resistance through the water in order to improve reach and distance-per-stroke. <br> <br> <u>Patented 'Skeg' Along Underneath of Paddle:</u><br> Creates a gliding effect in the front of each Freestyle pull, which in turn elongates the entire stroke cycle. <br> <br> <u>Cut out Wrist Shape:</u><br> Helps eliminate stress on shoulders and prevent injuries. <br> <br> <u>Flexible Rubber Tubing:</u><br> Straps to fingers to lock paddle in place.</p> <p><strong>Product Video</strong></p> <p> <object width="""" height=""""><param name="""" movie value="""" http:><param name="""" allowfullscreen value="""" true><param name="""" allowscriptaccess value="""" always><embed src="""" http: type="""" application allowscriptaccess="""" always allowfullscreen="""" true width="""" height=""""></embed></object> </p>     </div>

        <p><strong>About Zoomers:</strong><br>  <br> Zoomers are a unique swim fin that utilize patented short-fin technology to promote a shorter, faster kick. They are designed to provide the ideal amount of propulsion for perfecting the swimming kick and stroke, allowing for better form over longer periods of time. Because they have a smaller blade than traditional fins, Zoomers make the legs work harder without overloading the muscles. They help you avoid burnout and sustain an optimum workout level over a longer period.</p> <p>Zoomers fins allow you to practice swimming at or above race-level speeds without being rested or shaved. For each speed in the water, there is a size of the kick that works best. The kick creates propulsion that moves you forward, but each time the legs separate in the flutter kick, they create drag which slows you down. At higher speeds, the drag created can potentially cancel out the extra effort put in. A smaller kick creates less drag, but also less propulsion. Zoomers are designed to help practice and perfect this smaller kick by providing just enough extra propulsion while avoiding additional drag.</p> <p><strong>Red vs. Blue Zoomers:<br> </strong>Zoomers come in two models. Red for advanced competitive swimmers with a developed, strong kick, and blue for swimmers who are looking for a strength-training workout.<br> <br> <strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong><br>  </p> <p>To get a great workout, you must exercise a large percentage of the body's muscle mass at a reasonably high level of intensity for a long period of time or over a long distance. Due to the nature of swimming, swimmers often fall below this optimum level of workout, usually due to the difficulty in sustaining an efficient kick.</p> <p>Zoomers make the legs work harder, but the smaller blade will not overload leg muscles, therefore a high level of intensity can be maintained for a longer period of time. The additional propulsion allows the arms to cycle faster, providing the opportunity to breathe more and increase the oxygen intake needed to sustain the effort of the leg muscles.</p> <p>We do not race at slow speeds, yet most workouts are done at sub-race speeds. Therefore, we spend much of our time practicing techniques for slower swimming - a different size kick, speed, arm turnover rate, body planing position and arm entry angle. Zoomers make it possible to practice correct race pace techniques for extended periods of time.</p> <p>With Zoomers you can train at or above race speeds, resulting in improvements to high-speed neuromuscular coordination and a reduction in the upper-body stress associated with sprint training. The core of your workout is improved, allowing you to become a better swimmer with a stronger, faster kick.</p> <p><strong>Product Video</strong></p> <p><object height="""" width=""""> <param name="""" movie value="""" http:> <param name="""" allowfullscreen value="""" true> <param name="""" allowscriptaccess value="""" always><embed type="""" application height="""" width="""" allowfullscreen="""" true allowscriptaccess="""" always src="""" http:></embed></object></p>     </div>

        <p><strong>PT Paddles</strong></p>
<p>Swimming is not a natural form of  locomotion, and as a result technique can be more important than  physical strength and fitness. Effective swimming involves the use of  the whole body working with the water, not fighting against it.</p>
<p>PT Paddles are designed to help you find and develop your <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">P</span>erfect <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">T</span>echnique</strong> in the water. The proper use of the paddles will improve the technical aspects of your stroke:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase Coordination</li>
<li>Build Core Strength</li>
<li>Create a ""Feel for the Water""</li>
<li>Maximize Distance per Stroke</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How they Work:</strong></p>
<p>PT  Paddles are shaped to deflect water around your hand, effectively  removing the hands from the swimming equation. By removing the hand as a  paddle, swimmers have to find other methods of generating propulsion.<br> <br> Because your hand can no longer 'grip' the water, your body will need  to adjust your stroke. The elbow is positioned higher, the hips roll a  little further, and the forearm is activated earlier, allowing you to  catch and pull yourself through the water.<br> <br> Wearing the PT  Paddles overtime increases your body awareness and muscle memory. Then  when you swim normally without the paddles, you will feel stronger and  faster in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ergonomically  designed for comfort and made of engineered materials with a very  similar density to water to create a natural swimming stroke</li>
<li>Comprised of durable PU material that is UV and chlorine resistant</li>
<li>Textured upper surface for grip</li>

        Snorkel Dry-Top - For Swimmer's Snorkel

Patented design helps keep your snorkel free of water.

    * When submerging under the water, a small buoy inside the Dry-Top rises, effectively sealing the tube.
    * Water is then prevented from entering, keeping your snorkel completely dry!
    * When you surface, the buoy drops, opening the air passage for maximum airflow.


    * For use on FINIS Swimmer's Snorkels only.
    * Not compatible with the ""Freestyle Snorkel"" or ""Learn-to-Swim Snorkel"".

Note that using the Snorkel Dry Top will slightly restrict air-flow into the tube. The Dry-Top attachment is recommended for experienced users.

<p><strong>Training Tips</strong></p>
<p>While both variables, distance per kick and tempo (speed of movement), must be emphasized from the start in skill development and training, a bias should be directed to more emphasis upon distance per kick.</p>
<p>It is important to incorporate the use of the core body strength into power development in the kicking motion. Keeping the body too rigid, with the kick inside the body alignment, will result in diminished distance per kick. Let the hand, arms and body go for bigger range of motion and more distance per kick. Use exaggerated<br>
movements in your training.</p>
<p>Measure you distance per kick by counting kicks over a given distance. Measure tempo by timing a specific number of kick, and determine seconds per kick (example: .45 seconds per kick)</p>
<p>You can also learn and practice kicking on your side (Fish Kicking), rather than on your front (Dolphin Kicking)</p>

</div>
<div class=""bullet-box"">It’s the next best thing to having your own personal running coach. Forerunner® 620 offers advanced features like recovery advisor, race predictor and VO₂ max estimate to help you train smarter and achieve new race goals. When used with the HRM-Run monitor, the 620 also provides feedback on running form by showing your cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillation. For indoor training, the 620’s built-in accelerometer tracks distance, so you don’t need a separate foot pod.<br><br><strong>It Knows Your Potential</strong><br>Regardless of how long you’ve been running, you likely want to know how you can improve and objectively measure your fitness. Forerunner® 620 does just that by estimating your VO₂ max, which is a good indicator of athletic capability. Previously, the only way to know your VO₂ max was by paying for a lab test. When used with a heart rate monitor, the 620 crunches several pieces of data, like your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate your VO₂ max. The number itself indicates the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute, per kilogram of body weight at your max performance.<br>A color gauge on the watch shows how your VO₂ max data compares to other runners of your gender and age range. Based on your VO₂ max estimate, the 620 can predict your race times for several distances. This can give you a time target for your next race, assuming you’ve completed proper training.<br><br><strong>Rest Day or Run Day</strong><br>Forerunner® 620 takes out the guesswork when it comes to planning your recovery time between hard workouts. Just like a coach, it learns you and your physiology based on your heart rate data, so it factors this against your last workout and then shows how much time before you are fully recovered and ready for your next hard running workout.<br>When wearing HRM-Run, the 620 provides a recovery check, which is a real-time indication of your state of recovery within the first several minutes of your run. When you’ve completed a run, the recovery time shows how long before you should attempt another hard workout. Color coding on the gauge makes it easy to interpret — green means you’re good to go. When you see red and a recovery time of more than 3 days, you might consider taking a rest day or just doing a light recovery run. <br><br><strong>Following Your Form</strong><br>The 620 is the first GPS running watch that provides feedback on your running form by reporting multiple metrics. When used with the HRM-Run monitor, the 620 reports your cadence, vertical oscillation and ground contact time. These metrics are called running dynamics, and they impact your running economy.<br>The HRM-Run has an accelerometer, which measures your torso movement as you run in order to compute these metrics. Cadence is the total number of steps you take per minute, left and right foot combined. Vertical oscillation is the degree of “bounce” in your running motion, measured in centimeters. Ground contact time is just like it sounds — the amount of time your foot spends on the ground during each running step, measured in milliseconds. A color gauge makes it easy to see how your running dynamics compare to other runners.<br><br><strong>Get Connected</strong><br>Thanks to its wireless upload capabilities, Forerunner® 620 can send your run data to our online community, Garmin Connect, without being connected to a computer. It can transfer the data through the Garmin Connect™ Mobile app on your smartphone. You can also set up one or more Wi-Fi hot spots, like your home and office networks, and the 620 will automatically sync with Garmin Connect when in range.<br>Additional connected features include live tracking, which allows your friends and fans to follow along and see your stats in real-time. You must have your phone paired with the 620 throughout your run to use the LiveTrack feature. You can also share your victories on your social media sites by posting updates through the Garmin Connect Mobile app. And, for real-time coaching as you run, the 620 is compatible with free training plans at Garmin Connect. By regularly connecting your watch to Garmin Connect, you'll also benefit from a faster GPS fix due to satellite data that will be sent to your device automatically.</div>

        <p>The Bar Fly 2.0 is designed with an aerodynamic low profile that  places the Garmin Computer screen inline, out front, and level with the  handlebar/stem.  Wether you are using the Garmin 200/500 or larger  510/800/810, our clever Dual Mounting Position design is optimized with  no screws to lose and no bolts to adjust.  </p>
<p>Taking aesthetic and  function one step further, we've engineered a platform for Shimano Di2  and Campagnolo EPS electronic shifting modules on the underside of the  2.0.   This platform will also integrate with a safety light to be  released summer 2013.</p>
<p>Our single bolt,<strong> Full Wrap Clamp </strong>is  easy to install without removing the handlebar tape and is added  protection that your Garmin will never ""fall off"" even without the bolt  over the roughest terrain.    </p>
<p>Tested at the highest level.  The  Bar Fly is the preferred choice of Pro Tour road cyclist, Ironman  triathletes, and World Champion mountain bike racers. </p>
<p><strong>Plastic on Plastic design.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Garmin  computers are made of Plastic and so is the Bar Fly.  We chose Delrin,  the highest quality plastic, because it is the most appropriate material  for this key interface.  Hard materials such as aluminum have been  found to ""eat away,"" and ""shave off,"" material that can permanently  damage your Garmin computer.   </li>
<li>With Bar Fly products there is always Zero Risk of over-tightening </li>

<p>Just like a coach, Forerunner® 220 provides the motivating feedback you need to guide your training. You can even get post-run encouragement from friends and fans, thanks to the 220’s connected features like real-time live tracking and social media sharing via the Garmin Connect Mobile™ app.<br><br><strong>A Coach in Every Watch</strong><br>Forerunner® 220 measures essential running data like distance, pace and heart rate¹. It’s like having a coach on hand, providing constant feedback and recording all your stats so you can focus on your run. In addition to using GPS to calculate distance and pace, the 220 has a built-in accelerometer. This allows it to capture distance and pace data when you’re running on an indoor track or treadmill, with no need for a separate foot pod accessory. The accelerometer can also track distance when GPS is unavailable, such as when you run through a tunnel. It’s compatible with free training plans from Garmin Connect™, which you can schedule and send to your watch, for real-time coaching.<br><br><strong>Easy to Use</strong><br>The 220 is one of the first Garmin running watches to have a color display, which makes it easy to interpret your data at a glance. It also features simple button operations and a sturdy, hinged wristband that’s comfortable for any size wrist.<br><br><strong>Extra Training Features</strong><br>You can set up alerts for heart rate, pace or run/walk intervals to help you stay in the desired range. The 220 features vibration alerts and audible alerts, and you can customize your watch to provide both or just one type of prompt. When your run’s done and saved in your watch’s history, a post-run summary appears so you can see how you did. The 220 also notices if you hit any personal records on that run, like your fastest kilometer, 5k, 10k, half or full marathon or your longest run to date. <br><br><strong>Get Connected</strong><br>If you’re like most runners, you want to analyze your stats after your run or race, but you may not be back at your computer right away. Forerunner® 220 solves that by automatically uploading your data to Garmin Connect, our free online community where you can save, plan and share your activities. Just download the free Garmin Connect Mobile app to your smartphone and then pair your watch. When you save your completed run, it will automatically upload to Garmin Connect when you’re in range of your phone.<br><br>Additional connected features include live tracking, which allows your friends and fans to follow along and see your stats in real-time.

        <p>We introduced the Bar Fly mounting system and revolutionized the perception of how a cycling computer should be attached to a bicycle. This perception has created a shift in thinking and with it we have seen the demand expose many different needs of athletes and recreational cyclists. At Tate Labs we’ve always envisioned one mount that would function flawlessly to serve the needs of multiple user groups. The introduction of the Bar Fly 1.1 enables an interface for each of those user groups whether they are recreationalist, mountain bikers, road cyclist, triathletes, or cycle-cross riders. You could say we were interested in versatility, but truth be told, we’re more interested in simplicity and functionality.</p>

The 1/8th turn mechanism is a patent pending positive engagement system that enables cross compatibility with all Garmin Edge series cycling computers, and the Garmin Forerunner 910 XT and 310 XT watches. With Bar Fly 1.1 transitioning between multiple computers from dirt to pavement and run to bike has never been this easy. Stay centered on all your bikes with Bar Fly 1.1.</p>
<p>Made in the USA out of Delrin with no screws to lose, Bar Fly 1.1 is the only mount that positions all of your Garmin devices directly in the center of the handlebar in a safe and aesthetic viewing position. </p>

        <p>At Tate Labs, we have in depth product knowledge and hands on  experience with some of the world’s fastest most technologically  advanced aerodynamic components.   These insights helped us in creating  the Bar Fly TT.  </p>
<p>The Bar Fly TT was designed specifically for  Triathletes and Time Trialists, and incorporates the same patent pending  1/8th turn mechanism used on the Bar Fly 1.1.  Because 1/8th turn  allows the display to be mounted in 90’ increments,  Bar Fly TT is  compatible with the Garmin Forerunner watch and Garmin Edge series  cycling computers.   Bar Fly TT accepts a variety of mounting options  for both computers along either side of the aero extensions and allows  plenty of room for your aero bar mounted hydration and nutrition  accessories.</p>

<h3>Rugged GPS Navigator in a tactical design</h3>
<ul>
<li>High-sensitivity GPS positioning with automatic calibrating altimeter, barometer and 3-axis compass</li>
<li>Bold and rugged all-black stylish design. It's scratch-resistant, curved lens is rugged and prevents reflection</li>
<li>Negative mode liquid crystal display with green LED</li>
<li>TracBack® reverses the track log to navigate back to your starting point</li>
<li>Mark up to 1,000 waypoints and store up to 10,000 track points</li>
</ul>
<p>The field-ready tactix is a high-sensitivity GPS navigator plus ABC watch packed with features to securely explore the great outdoors. Inside, it’s an altimeter, barometer, 3-axis compass and tracker with 1,000 waypoints, 10,000 track points and TracBack capabilities. Outside, it is waterproof (to 50 meters), matte black and non-reflective with a green LED backlight that won’t flare out night vision.</p>
<h3>Plan, Navigate, Track</h3>
<p>tactix lets you create routes, record up to 1,000 waypoints and record GPS breadcrumb trails on the move (tracklogs). Navigate to coordinates, along a track or route, toward waypoints or along any other selected bearing. The TracBack function guides you back along a previously recorded tracklog so you can easily find your way to the campsite, trailhead or safety of a vehicle, even in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Plan trips and share adventures with friends and family using BaseCamp™ and BaseCamp Mobile. tactix is equipped with both ANT+™ capabilities and Bluetooth® to wirelessly share tracks, waypoints and routes with other compatible Garmin devices or smartphones.</p>
<h3>Altimeter, Barometer and Compass</h3>
<p>tactix is equipped with ABC sensors (altimeter, barometer and compass) to provide relevant real-time information. The built-in altimeter provides elevation data to accurately monitor ascent and descent, while the barometer can be used to predict weather changes by showing short-term trends in air pressure. The 3-axis electronic compass keeps your bearing whether you’re moving or not.</p>
<p>tactix auto-calibrates its ABC sensors using its GPS receiver and also auto sets the time based on location. For an extremely accurate temperature reading, pair it with our tempe™ external temperature sensor.</p>
<h3>Measure Performance</h3>
<p>tactix provides real-time performance data, such as distance, pace, cadence and calories, helping you keep track of your progress during and after your adventures. tactix is compatible with our heart rate monitor, speed/cadence bike sensor and foot pod — for indoor or outdoor use.</p>
<h3>Built to Endure the Roughest Conditions</h3>
<p>tactix combines a strong housing to survive shocks with a mineral glass lens to resist scratching. It boasts a large LCD display with a green LED backlight and a robust polyurethane wristband. It’s waterproof to 50 meters and has a battery life of up to 50 hours in GPS mode (depends on settings) and up to 5 weeks in watch mode.</p>
<h3>Tactical-Inspired</h3>
<p>The all-black, rugged and durable ABC plus GPS-enabled tactix was inspired by the strict design requirements mandated by Tactical units for the gear they use in the field. This bold all-black watch is stealthy, yet stylish. Its scratch-resistant, curved lens is rugged and prevents reflection. The Jumpmaster mode is invaluable to airborne operations. The green backlight won’t compromise your position or your vision (and won’t flare out night-vision goggles).</p>
<h3>More Than an Ordinary Watch</h3>
<p>tactix includes sun/moon information and a hunt/fish calendar in addition to basic watch functions such as alarms, tones, vibration alerts, a timer, stopwatch and world clock with the ability to display several times zones at once. It even allows you to control our VIRB™ and VIRB Elite™ action cameras.</p>

<h3>True 1080p HD Action Camera with Wi-Fi, GPS</h3>
<ul>
<li>1080p HD video recording with 16 megapixel CMOS image processor</li>
<li>1.4"" Chroma display</li>
<li>High-sensitivity GPS, accelerometer and barometric altimeter</li>
<li>Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (record up to 3 hours at 1080p)</li>
<li>Rugged, durable, waterproof (IPX7¹) with an aerodynamic design</li>
</ul>
<h3>High Definition Recording</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 12px;"">VIRB records true HD 1080p video that lets you relive every minute of your adventure in full, high-contrast, undistorted detail. Adjust resolution and filming speed for crisp, dramatic slow motion up to 120fps. And it’s all seen through our WideVü lens and processed through 16 megapixel CMOS sensor for the highest quality video, even before you start editing it. Set multiple HD video modes: 1080p@30fps, 960p@48fps, 720p@30/60fps, 848x480@120fps.</p>
<h3>1.4"" Chroma Display</h3>
<p>Why mash a button and hope you got the shot when you can set-up, preview and playback video on a built-in, full-color Chroma display? The 1.4"" display on VIRB Elite is also your window into the menu settings. Check your shot before you leap, choose slow motion, or even switch between video and still photography. It’s always on the screen, and the screen is always on (but uses minimal power).</p>
<h3>Long-life Battery</h3>
<p>VIRB Elite features a class-leading 2000 mAh lithium-ion battery that tested up to 3 hours recording at 1080p. Which means there’s a good chance you’ll tire out before the battery does. And with multiple charging options (sold separately) you’ll have plenty of juice. Extend your filming time by carrying a replacement battery (sold separately) on your all-day adventure.</p>
<h3>GPS and Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>VIRB Elite has high-sensitivity GPS for data stamping and GPS-based “smart” recording profiles such as Skiing Mode, which automatically records your downhill runs and stops recording while you’re getting hot cocoa or waiting in the lift line.</p>
<p>It's also equipped with Wi-Fi for wireless communication to your smartphone or computer. So you can see the image preview, control for playback, adjust camera settings, and record and stop the camera or remotely snap still photos, even while the camera is filming.</p>
<h3>ANT+ and External Sensors</h3>
<p>VIRB uses ANT+™ wireless connectivity so you can use a compatible Garmin device, such as fēnix, Oregon and Edge, as remote controls. And because it has Wi-Fi, you can stop and start recording or take still images wirelessly with your smart phone or compatible Garmin device so you don’t have to take your hands off the handlebars or remove the camera from the mount for that perfect shot.</p>
<p>ANT+ also works with our external sensors. Pair VIRB Elite with our tempe (wireless temperature sensor), speed/cadence bike sensor or premium heart rate monitor to include revealing information in your videos. Show how fast your heart was racing on your last bike race or while peering over the edge of the Grand Canyon. VIRB Elite also has a built-in accelerometer and altimeter for data stamping and custom filming profiles.</p>
<h3>Sleek and Easy-to-use</h3>
<p>VIRB Elite was engineered for easy operation with a large, instant record slider switch on the side of the camera. The slide and click of the switch makes it easy to know that you are recording, even if you’re wearing gloves. The overall design of the camera is both sleek and rugged which helps you integrate VIRB Elite into your activity without having to work around a bulky camera body. So go ahead and ski, zip-line or bobsled, knowing you got the shot.</p>
<h3>Digital Stabilization</h3>
<p>With the Digital Stabilization feature engaged, VIRB Elite adds a little stability to bumpy rides and adventures so you can share a smoother video with your friends. Plus Lens Distortion Correction (LDC) works to enhance the quality of your video, even before you start editing.</p>
<h3>High Definition Photography</h3>
<p>VIRB Elite is a high-powered digital photo camera too. With 16 megapixel photo capture LDC to make your photos sharper, clearer and less distorted. Shoot 16 megapixel, 12 megapixel or 8 megapixel as a single shot (on-camera button or controlled remotely) or choose Photo Burst or Time Lapse at various intevals. And it’s all processed through a 16 megapixel CMOS processor for high quality images.</p>
<h3>Video and Photographs at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Don’t lose a moment of video just to capture a photograph. VIRB Elite lets you take still photos at the same time you are recording video with just a touch of the button on either your remote Garmin device or on the camera itself.</p>
<h3>Editing Made Easy</h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">VIRB Edit i</span>s free desktop editing software that you can download to your computer for intuitive, robust video editing that takes advantage of VIRB Elite's compatibility with external and built-in sensors and other Garmin devices. Include your speed and heart rate on your motorcycle video, or accelerometer and altitude on your sky dive video. Once you have the video you want to share, upload it for all your friends to see.</p>
<h3>Mounts</h3>
<p>A variety of mounts let you firmly lock the camera in position, virtually anywhere. From curved, flat deck and dash mounts to handlebar, helmet, shoulder and multi-use strap mounts, our mounts have you covered. Mounts have interlocking joints that grip in place instead of relying solely on tension for a more durable, anti-vibration locking performance. We even have an adapter to use VIRB Elite with other industry mounts.</p>
<h3>Optional Dive Case</h3>
<p>VIRB Elite is rugged and waterproof to IPX7 right out of the box meaning the device will withstand incidental exposure to water of up to 1 meter in depth for up to 30 minutes. For all activities that involve water immersion, the optional Dive Case is required. The Dive Case increases the waterproof rating to 50 meters and features a flat front lens for clear underwater imaging.</p>    </div>

        <p>Log your daily activities, everyday with the Sony SmartBand.</p>
<p>The SWR10 SmartBand is an innovative Life logging wrist band that lets you keep track of everything you do.</p>
<p>Pairing with your smartphone via low energy Bluetooth, activities are logged in Sony's Lifelog app. These activities include your physical, social and entertainment activities. You can see how active you were, where you went, what pictures you took, where and when, what the weather was like and how you have been communicating with your world during any day.</p>
<p>All of this activity is used to allocate activity points and encourage you to be more active. Think of it a motivational tool on your wrist and in your pocket.</p>
<h3>Movement/Activity Monitor </h3>
<p>The Lifelog app can see if you havve been walking, driving, cycling, travelling by train and even how you have slept.</p>
<p>It counts steps, calculates speed, and can even monitor your sleep pattern and wake you up when you’ve slept enough according to your sleep cycle. It’s nice to know how much you move. And where.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Log</h3>
<p>The SmartWear Lifelog app collects all your camera and music activities and presents them in a fun</p>
<p>and animated interface along with your activity. On any day, you can see what pictures/video you took, what music you were listening to and for how long. And what you were doing at the time.</p>
<h3>Communications Log</h3>
<p><strong></strong>In the Lifelog app display, you can see how much you were communicating with your friends, what was said, when and how. You can look back on your life and your journey through it.</p>

<p>An iconic light metal fastening button and LEDs give it a premium look and feel.</p>
<h3>Seamless Connection</h3>
<p><strong></strong>In constant contact with your smartphone via Bluetooth and to the cloud via your smartphone, you can be assured of an always up to date activity log.</p>
<p>Connecting the SWR10 is easy using one touch NFC or using a standard Bluetooth connection procedure.</p>
<p>When you go out of range (up to 10 m) of your smartphone, a gentle vibrating SmartBand alert will let you know. Even when you’re out of range of your smartphone, SmartBand will save information about what you do and pass it on when you re-connect.</p>
<h3>Smart Alarm</h3>
<p><strong></strong>By tracking body movements, SmartBand will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep cycle. It calculates and measures the best time to wake up and gently vibrates just after your last dream is over.</p>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p><strong></strong>When a call, message, Facebook update or other notification comes in, SmartBand will vibrate gently on your wrist and let you know. It also has LED indicators which light up to show that SmartBand is active.</p>
<h3><strong>Music Remote</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>When you’re enjoying your music on the move you can play, pause and skip track using SmartBand. Tap the band or turn your wrist to control your music.</p>

<p>Echo is the first running watch that utilizes smartphone fitness apps to their full potential by wirelessly connecting them to your wrist. With real-time fitness data streaming directly from your smartphone to the watch display and the ability to remotely control connected apps, Echo keeps you informed and in control during any run.</p>
<p>Echo is an extension of your smartphone, simultaneously displaying fitness data, notifications and achievements that display on your smartphone. Using Bluetooth Smart to wirelessly connect with smartphones, Echo shows elapsed time, distance and other fitness metrics at a glance. Echo gives you control over a variety of smartphone functions including start, stop or lap on your fitness app, and next song, play and pause on your music stream or playlist.</p>
<p>It’s the first smart watch designed for running with a ruggedized design and water-resistance that can withstand adverse conditions. When you’re not running, Echo is an everyday watch. A replaceable battery means there’s no charging. Echo is always ready to go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real time fitness data stream</strong><br> Fitness data, like pace and distance, stream from your app to Echo in real-time. Now, you can actually see the data that’s been hiding on your smartphone.</li>
<li><strong>Fitness Apps</strong><br> With an open platform, Echo works with your favorite fitness app today and the new fitness apps of tomorrow. Apps are constantly updating their features and Echo is designed to keep pace and evolve.</li>
<li><strong>App Messages and Alerts</strong><br> Apps control the experience on Echo, including the messages it displays. These could be encouraging words from a friend, instructions for your next interval, or notification of an achievement.</li>
<li><strong>Smartphone Compatibility</strong><br> Compatible with iPhone 4S, 5, 5C and 5S. Android Smartphone support coming soon.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless Communication</strong><br> Embedded Bluetooth Smart technology creates a low power connection between your smartphone and watch to stream data and remotely control your apps.</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong><br> Using ultra low-power components, Echo uses a replaceable coin cell battery. Which means no charging, ever.</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong><br> 1"" (2.54 cm) high resolution display allows for superior readability in varying light conditions -- especially bright light. A backlight may be turned on for darker conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Invertible Screens</strong><br> The screen background and characters can be inversed from black to gray to match your mood or preference.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Controls</strong><br> With your smartphone safely tucked away, you can remotely control app functions like start, stop, and lap, as well as remotely control the music on your smartphone.</li>
<li><strong>Tap Screen</strong><br> Tapping the display will advance to the next data screen or close a notification that is displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Everyday Watch</strong><br> Sleek design and watch functions (time of day, day, and date) make it the perfect watch for a tech savvy athlete.</li>
<li><strong>Water-Resistance</strong><br> With a 30 meters water-resistant rating, it’s rugged design can be worn in heavy rain and the shower.</li>
<li><strong>Rugged</strong><br> Designed with the runner in mind, Echo is sporty and rugged enough to look good while running and to withstand the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong> Watch configurations are 100% controlled by the fitness app and you. Some apps will allow you to customize every data screen and button controls, while others will keep it simple and control the experience. Choose from digital or analog watch faces to match your style.</li>

<h3>** Available online only (Free delivery within Singapore)</h3>
<p>You swim. You bike. You run. You obsess over data and details. So do we. And we’ve just perfected your new training partner. Forerunner 910XT is the only all-in-one, GPS-enabled device that provides detailed swim metrics and tracks distance, pace, elevation and heart rate¹ for running and cycling. It sports a sleek profile, comfy wristband and an easy-to-read display.</p>
<h3>Dive In</h3>
<p style=""float: right;""> </p>
<p>Designed for open water and pool swimming, Forerunner 910XT is water resistant to 50 m (164 ft). It’s our first multisport watch to offer extensive swim metrics, including swim distance, stroke identification, stroke count and pool lengths. It also computes your swolf score to help you gauge your swimming efficiency. The 910XT’s robust design and easy operations make it suited for other water sports, including paddle boarding.</p>
<p>Because it’s GPS-enabled, Forerunner 910XT even captures the path you traveled so you can view it later on a map in our free online community, Garmin Connect™. This feature can help you analyze your open water swimming and adjust your technique as needed.</p>
<h3>Transition Seamlessly</h3>
<p>Whether you’re training or racing, every second counts, so the 910XT makes it easy and seamless to transition between sports. The auto multisport feature lets you switch sport modes with just 1 button press, so you don’t lose precious seconds in transition. The optional quick release mount allows you to move the 910XT easily from wrist to bike.</p>
<h3>Try It Dry</h3>
<p>On land, Forerunner 910XT offers many of the features of our advanced cycling computers and sport watches to accurately capture your time, distance, speed or pace. The 910XT is our first multisport device to incorporate a barometric altimeter for highly accurate elevation data, including ascent, descent and grade. Configurable data fields let you customize multiple training pages for each sport. Set up vibration alerts to give a silent nudge when you hit a split, when it’s time to take nutrition or if you need a little feedback to stay within range of your goals. With these high-level features and up to 20 hours of battery life, the 910XT is ideal for athletes training for ultras or iron distance tris.</p>
<h3>Take It to the Next Level</h3>
<p>For advanced training, the 910XT is compatible with ANT+™ sensors, including the optional speed/cadence sensor for cycling or premium heart rate monitor (included with some models). You can pair the 910XT with an existing ANT+ heart rate monitor or purchase as an accessory. Track your weight, body fat, body water and 6 other measurements when using the 910XT with the Tanita BC-1000 body composition scale. The readings are stored on Forerunner 910XT, then automatically sent to Garmin Connect when in range of your computer.</p>
<p>And for those data-driven athletes, the 910XT also is compatible with ANT+ power meters, such as Vector™, our pedal-based power meter.</p>
<h3>Plan, Analyze and Share</h3>
<p>Make the most of every workout by uploading to Garmin Connect. Here, you can see your activity on a map and view detailed metrics. You also can use Connect to plan new routes, create and schedule custom workouts and explore activities from other users. Through the magic of ANT+ wireless technology and the tiny USB stick that comes with your 910XT, your workout data automatically transfers to your computer when in range. Garmin Connect is Mac® and Windows® compatible.</p>

        <h1><strong>Automatic swimming computer with Heart Rate and Vibrating Alarm</strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong><br> <strong>Heart rate in and out of the water</strong>-  Most heart rate monitors do not work under water*. The PoolMateHR has been specially designed for swimmers so it will transmit when in the pool. View your heart rate on the watch during your swim and download afterwards for further analysis. You can also use it as a heart rate monitor out of the pool for other activities.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic lap and stroke counting for each lap</strong>-  The PoolMateHR has all our swim monitoring functions including laps, strokes, speed, distance, calories, stroke length, strokes per minute and efficiency which are automatically calculated from your arm movements. In addition to the set by set information shown by the PoolMate and PoolMatePro, the PoolMateHR downloads data for each individual lap you swim.</p>
<p><strong>Vibrating alarm-</strong>  Our unique vibrating alarm alerts you when you have swam a certain number of laps, distance or time interval- a really great innovation to keep track in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>Tough but stylish-</strong>  The PoolMateHR has a sleek but tough design with sapphire crystal glass and a ceramic bezel so it stands up to the hardest swim session and is suitable for everyday wear too.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable and rechargeable-</strong> The PoolMateHR comes with it’s own USB pod which charges the watch and downloads the data to your computer. The battery should last a few weeks with normal use so wont need charging too often.</p>

<p><strong>The vibrating alarm is such a useful tool and we think it’s one of the key features. There are several ways to use it.</strong></p>
<p>1, Set it to go off every 10 laps (or any multiple of laps you like) and it will gently shake the watch so you can feel the buzz on your arm so you don’t need to look at your watch to see how many laps you have swam.</p>
<p>2, Set it to go off every 100m (or any distance interval) so you can feel the buzz each time you have completed this distance.</p>
<p>3, Set it to go off after 30 minutes (or any long time interval) so it will alert you when you have swam for your allotted time (you can also use it in chrono mode this way when doing other activities).</p>
<p>4, Imagine you want to swim at a pace of 90 seconds per 100m. Set the vibrate alarm to go off every 90 seconds (or any short time interval) and feel the buzz each 100m. This is a great way to keep your pace correct in a longer set. If you feel the buzz exactly at the 100m turn you know you are on track (you can use this in chrono mode too of course).</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 13px;"">The software is simple and easy to use, </strong><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">you can use it with the PoolMatePro and PoolMateHR you just wont be able to see any lap by lap or heart rate data on the PoolMatePro.</span></p>

        <p>The ergonomically advanced design of the Agility Paddles helps teach swimmers the correct palm positive hand position. Due to the paddles strapless design, incorrect technique will cause the paddle to fall off the swimmer’s hand. The Agility Paddles’ convex design also promotes an early catch and reminds the swimmer to maintain an early vertical forearm position. This versatile paddle works for all four strokes and accommodates most hand sizes. Not only are the Agility Paddles durable, but the absence of straps makes them more comfortable for the swimmers and easier for coaches, who no longer have to hassle with broken straps during practice.</p>

<h2><strong>Bone Conduction</strong></h2>
<p>As humans, we are able to detect sound vibrations through the air via our eardrums (Air Conduction) or through our bones directly into our inner ear (Bone Conduction). Because there is no air under the water, Bone Conduction is the best way to hear audio while swimming.</p>
<p>The speakers of the Neptune sit on the cheek, just in front of the ear. These speakers vibrate the jaw bones and send vibrations to the inner-ear or Cochlea. The result is an amazing audio experience that makes it feel as if the music is playing inside your head. The ears are free and clear, and there are no earbuds to mess with.</p>
<p>Bone Conduction is a safe and proven method of sound transmission that has been used in phone headsets and hearing aids. In fact, Bone Conduction audio is used by whales and dolphins to listen to one another underwater.</p>

By introducing the first set of earphones that was  specifically engineered with arm mounted digital media players and smart  phones in mind, the iRun Advantage shatters the idea that ""one size  fits all"".  Through ergonomics and anatomical engineering, iRun has  created an earphone that not only shortens the overall wire length by  more than 35%, but also realizes that both ears require different length  wires to create the most streamlined, efficient and worry-free earphone  configuration available in the world. This advance in engineering and  design allows you to enjoy listening to your music and focus on your  training without the distractions those other earphones creates. <br><br> iRun… Stay Focused and Untangle Your Life.</p>
<p><strong>26.5” Long<br><br> Designed specifically for arm-mounted use<br><br> Exclusive offset earphone design<br><br> Compatible with iPod, iPhone, Smart phones and all media players<br></strong></p>    </div>

<li><strong>Bone Conduction Audio Announcement</strong><br>Verbally conveys your heart rate through your jawbone into your inner ear; no ear buds needed </li>
<li><strong>Infrared Sensor Technology</strong><br>Picks up heart rate through your earlobe</li>
<li><strong>Announcement Increments</strong><br>Set the device to announce every 10 secs, 20secs, 30secs, 45secs, 1min, 2mins or 5mins</li>

<div class=""repeat"">
<p> </p>
<p>Simply slip the AquaPulse inside your goggle  strap, attach the soft rubber clip to your earlobe, and go swim. Using  an infrared sensor to monitor capillary blood flow, your heart beat is  detected through your earlobe. The heart rate is then audibly  communicated to you in real time, where the information is transmitted  directly to your inner ear via Bone Conduction Technology. No ear buds,  cumbersome chest straps, or watch devices are needed.</p>
<p>The heart rate announcements are made regularly in  20-second, 30-second, 45-second, 1-minute, 2-minute or 5-minute  increments. Push the “Instant Heart Rate” button to hear your last  reading again. Complete with a lithium-ion rechargeable battery, you can  use the AquaPulse from five to eight hours depending on the interval  setting. Simply plug the integrated USB directly into a USB port on your  computer to recharge.</p>

        <h3>Fitness Band That Moves at the Pace of Your Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learns your activity level and assigns a personalized daily goal</li>
<li>Displays steps, calories, distance; monitors sleep</li>
<li>Pairs with heart rate monitor¹ for fitness activities</li>
<li>1+ year battery life; water-resistant²</li>
<li>Save, plan and share progress at Garmin Connect™</li>
</ul>
<p>You already know the active steps you take now can improve your overall wellness today, tomorrow and well into your future. And while it seems simple to get out of that chair more often and move, making it stick is another matter. That’s where vívofit can turn good intentions into lifelong habits. It’s the only fitness band that greets you with a personalized daily goal, tracks your progress and reminds you when it’s time to move.</p>
<h3>Personalized Daily Goals</h3>
<p>vívofit learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, vívofit will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. At Garmin Connect™, our free online fitness community, you can earn virtual badges and view your progress.</p>
<h3>Tells Time and ""Time to Move""</h3>
<p>Research shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body’s production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, vívofit knows. A red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you’ve been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar.</p>
<h3>Keep Moving</h3>
<p>When you’re ready to take the next steps toward better health, vívofit has additional features to keep you motivated. Use a heart rate monitor¹ with vívofit to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information for any fitness activity, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym. At Garmin Connect, you can join online challenges with other vívofit users or start your own competition with friends to compete for virtual badges and bragging rights.</p>
<h3>Always On</h3>
<p>vívofit follows your progress 24/7, and it can stay on for more than a year without a battery change. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and vívofit will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. The vívofit band is water-resistant², so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free.</p>
<h3>Get Connected</h3>
<p>With the touch of one button, you can wirelessly sync vívofit with Garmin Connect to see a complete picture of your progress, join online challenges and earn virtual badges for extra motivation. You can access our free online community from your computer or on your compatible mobile device³ with the Garmin Connect™ Mobile app.</p>

        <h3>*** Online Exclusive</h3>
<h3>Full Featured Training Watch for Multisport Athletes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tracks distance, pace and heart rate¹</li>
<li>Calculates recovery time and VO2 max estimate (when used with a heart rate monitor¹)</li>
<li>HRM-Run™ monitor¹ adds data for cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillation</li>
<li>Connected features², including uploads to Garmin Connect™ and BaseCamp™ for live tracking and sharing</li>
<li>High-sensitivity GPS positioning, 3-axis compass with altimeter and barometer</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining the best features of our fitness and outdoor watches, the fēnix 2 is the ideal multisport athlete’s training partner. Whether running, climbing, riding, hiking, paddling, skiing or swimming, the fēnix 2 lets you easily switch between feature sets for easier access to the information you need. Switch from advanced fitness training features like VO2 max, Virtual Partner® and recovery advisor to high-sensitivity GPS tracking features like 3-axis compass and TracBack®. And with Smart Notification you can stay in touch, even while you’re out testing your mettle.</p>
<h3>Advanced Fitness Metrics</h3>
<p>fēnix 2 is packed with training features to tell you about your form and fitness. The first is the VO2 max estimator. When used with a heart rate monitor¹, fēnix 2 crunches data, including your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute. Track changes to your VO2 max to see your fitness gains and to compare with your peers. Other fitness metrics include recovery advisor with a recovery timer and recovery check, plus a Race Predictor, which estimates your ideal finish time based on your current VO2 max number.</p>
<h3>Running Dynamics Features</h3>
<p>fēnix 2 incorporates sophisticated Garmin running watch feedback on your running form by reporting multiple metrics. When used with the HRM-Run monitor¹, fēnix 2 reports your cadence, vertical oscillation and ground contact time. These metrics are called running dynamics, and they effect your running economy.</p>
<h3>Swim Profile and Ski-Board Mode</h3>
<p>The fēnix 2 isn’t just for outdoor fitness; special feature sets help swim training and skiing too. Borrowing from the Garmin Swim™, fēnix 2 tracks your distance, pace, stroke count and more. You just tell fēnix 2 the size of the pool you’re swimming in and begin your workout. Ski-Board mode puts speed, distance, vertical drop and an automatic run counter (with Auto Pause for the lift line) and more at your fingertips. You can even use your fēnix 2 as a glove-friendly remote, via ANT+™, for the VIRB™ and VIRB Elite action cameras.</p>
<h3>Navigate Your Way</h3>
<p>No other navigator GPS plus ABC (altimeter, barometer and compass) wristwatch offers you the combined training functions and our leading GPS technology. fēnix 2 provides comprehensive navigation and tracking functionalities as well as trip information to guide you on and off the beaten track. Its built-in sensors provide information on heading, elevation and weather changes. It’s built to endure the toughest outdoor conditions — and also makes a stylish day-to-day timepiece.</p>
<p>It records a track log creating a GPS “bread crumb trail” as you move. It also allows you to mark waypoints, such as a start/finish line, course check point, or a campsite, vehicle or other point of interest. With fēnix 2, you can create and follow routes, mark up to 1,000 waypoints and store up to 10,000 track points.</p>
<p>Plan trips and share adventures with friends and family using BaseCamp. fēnix is equipped with both ANT+ and Bluetooth® capabilities to wirelessly share tracks, waypoints, routes and geocaches with other compatible Garmin devices or smartphones.</p>
<h3>Altimeter, Barometer and Compass</h3>
<p>fēnix 2 is equipped with ABC sensors to provide relevant real-time information. The built-in altimeter provides elevation data to accurately monitor ascent and descent, while the barometer can be used to predict weather changes by showing short-term trends in air pressure. The 3-axis electronic compass keeps your bearing whether you’re moving or not.</p>
<p>fēnix 2 auto-calibrates its ABC sensors using its GPS receiver and also auto sets the time based on location. For an extremely accurate temperature reading, pair it with our tempe™ external temperature sensor.</p>
<h3>Built to Endure the Roughest Conditions</h3>
<p>fēnix 2 combines a strong housing to survive shocks with a curved mineral glass lens to resist scratching. It boasts a large LCD display with a red LED backlight and a robust polyurethane wristband. An alternate fabric wrist strap (with hook-and-loop fastener) is also included with your fēnix 2 to accommodate all wrist sizes and so you can strap it on top of a heavy jacket. fēnix 2 is water rated to 5 ATM (50 meters) and has a battery life of up to 50 hours in GPS mode (depending on settings) and up to 5 weeks in watch mode. Basic watch functions include alarms, tones, vibration alerts, timer, stopwatch and world clock with the ability to display several times zones at once.</p>
<h3>Stay Connected</h3>
<p>Smart Notification lets you receive emails, texts and alerts right on your watch, even if you're on the trail. fēnix 2 receives the wireless signal from your iPhone® 4s or later, let’s you know you have a message, and displays the full text on its own screen whenever you’re ready to read it.</p>

        <p>The Positive Drive Fins (PDF’s) use a unique ellipsoidal blade to  generate correct propulsion in all swim strokes. Traditionally fins are  not made for Breaststroke, but the asymmetrical shape and adjustable  heel strap allows the swimmer to safely build power in the Breaststroke  kick. The short and wide blade design also promotes a natural inward  supination kick style for Backstroke, Butterfly, and Freestyle. The  PDF’s use an ergonomic footpocket to comfortably place the feet in the  ideal swimming position, and the heel strap to secure the fin, allowing  the feet to flex more naturally. A closed-toe construction provides  superior energy transfer from the leg to the foot. The PDF’s will  increase leg strength, foot speed, and ankle flexibility for all four  competitive swim strokes, making the fins great for training the  Individual Medley event. Available in multiple sizes for a custom fit.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small"">Invented by Bill Kirby, gold medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as part of the 4×200m freestyle relay team, he realized the importance of underwater training “It is physics, the faster you throw a ball against a wall, the faster it will bounce off. It is the same idea with turns, the faster you come into the wall the faster you can come off of it. The Turnmaster Pro allows more swimmers to practice their turns, being a fiberglass wall also makes it less intimidating for younger swimmers to approach at full race speed. During a race your two fastest places are coming off the blocks and coming off the wall. Practicing all aspects of the flip turn including the approach, the turn and a tight streamline off the wall all play a key role in success during competitions. “</span></p>

        ROM (Rang of Motion) Strap
The ROM Strap facilitates safe stretching of the sheet muscles which run from the shoulder blade to the torso. Enhanced streamlining and body roll combined with increased power output are the benefits of improved range of motion.

Features &amp; Benefits
The ROM Strap is designed to help stretch the arms, shoulders, shoulder blades, upper torso and rib cage. The ROM Strap passively retains each hand. This passive retention allows the transmission of pulling or traction forces up the arm without the need to contract the muscles of the hand, forearm and upper arm as would be necessary if the hands were not passively retained. This allows more effective stretching of the upper body.

Sizing
The ROM Strap should be safley used by people ages 14 and over.

WARNING: It is very important to stretch cautiously so no shoulder damage occurs. The shoulder is a muscle-retained joint: that is, the muscles which are in the area of the shoulder hold the shoulder joint together. To prevent injury, it is necessary to keep the muscles which hold the shoulder joint together lightly contracted so the shoulder is safe, while allowing other muscles of the area to relax so they can be stretched.    </div>

        <p><strong>About Zoomers:</strong><br> <br> Zoomers are a unique swim fin that utilize patented short-fin technology to promote a shorter, faster kick. They are designed to provide the ideal amount of propulsion for perfecting the swimming kick and stroke, allowing for better form over longer periods of time. Because they have a smaller blade than traditional fins, Zoomers make the legs work harder without overloading the muscles. They help you avoid burnout and sustain an optimum workout level over a longer period.</p> <p>Zoomers fins allow you to practice swimming at or above race-level speeds without being rested or shaved. For each speed in the water, there is a size of the kick that works best. The kick creates propulsion that moves you forward, but each time the legs separate in the flutter kick, they create drag which slows you down. At higher speeds, the drag created can potentially cancel out the extra effort put in. A smaller kick creates less drag, but also less propulsion. Zoomers are designed to help practice and perfect this smaller kick by providing just enough extra propulsion while avoiding additional drag.</p> <p><strong>Red vs. Blue Zoomers:<br> </strong>Zoomers come in two models. Red for advanced competitive swimmers with a developed, strong kick, and blue for swimmers who are looking for a strength-training workout.</p> <p><strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong><br>  </p> <p>To get a great workout, you must exercise a large percentage of the body's muscle mass at a reasonably high level of intensity for a long period of time or over a long distance. Due to the nature of swimming, swimmers often fall below this optimum level of workout, usually due to the difficulty in sustaining an efficient kick.</p> <p>Zoomers make the legs work harder, but the smaller blade will not overload leg muscles, therefore a high level of intensity can be maintained for a longer period of time. The additional propulsion allows the arms to cycle faster, providing the opportunity to breathe more and increase the oxygen intake needed to sustain the effort of the leg muscles.</p> <p>We do not race at slow speeds, yet most workouts are done at sub-race speeds. Therefore, we spend much of our time practicing techniques for slower swimming - a different size kick, speed, arm turnover rate, body planing position and arm entry angle. Zoomers make it possible to practice correct race pace techniques for extended periods of time.</p> <p>With Zoomers you can train at or above race speeds, resulting in improvements to high-speed neuromuscular coordination and a reduction in the upper-body stress associated with sprint training. The core of your workout is improved, allowing you to become a better swimmer with a stronger, faster kick.</p> <p><strong>Product Video</strong></p> <p><object height="""" width=""""> <param name="""" movie value="""" http:> <param name="""" allowfullscreen value="""" true> <param name="""" allowscriptaccess value="""" always><embed height="""" type="""" application width="""" allowfullscreen="""" true allowscriptaccess="""" always src="""" http:></embed></object></p>     </div>

        <p><strong>HydroSpeed 2 Female Race John:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Specialized female cut extends from neck to knee</li> <li>Open back design</li> <li>Available in Sizes 24-36</li> <br> </ul> <p><strong>A New Evolution of HydroSpeed:</strong></p> <p>HydroSpeed suits use specific water repellant and iso-panel characteristics to allow the athlete to perform at the highest level of competition. HydroSpeed suits are also built with tougher fabric and stitching, making it more durable than other similar racing suits on the market.</p> <p><strong>HydroSpeed Technology:</strong></p> <p>HydroSpeed 2 is the fusion of water and performance. The FINIS Development team has elevated the original HydroSpeed line and created a new racing suit with three unique elements:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Water-Repellency</strong> - In order to reduce the overall drag coefficient in the water, HydroSpeed 2 fabric is comprised of a light-weight, hollow-core SCALEX material, which allows for less water absorption. The embossed, scale-like finish deflects and whisks away water from the body. The suit effectively turns the body into a hydro-dynamic torpedo, with reduced drag and increased speed.</li> <li><strong>Smart Compression</strong> - The hollow-core Scalex material provides a comfortable compression against the body. The engineered fabric holds and presses muscle groups effectively, without squeezing and restricting muscle movement. Further, each suit is comprised of several different iso-panels that target specific compression levels for different muscle groups. By isolating and slightly pressing against the muscles, lactic acid levels are reduced and nerve senses are heighted The result allows athletes to be more aware of their body position and technique, swim more effectively at higher speeds and longer distances, and ultimately increase overall performance.</li> <li><strong>Durability</strong> - Knowing that Swimmers have multiple races in a season, the FINIS development team wanted to design the suit to last longer than other similar championship suits. By utilizing a stronger, double-layer fabric and secure flat-lock stitches, the HydroSpeed 2 suits guarantee durability without having to increase the overall weight of the suit. Each HydroSpeed 2 suit comes with a 30 day warranty from FINIS.</li> </ul>     </div>

        <div id="""" tab1cont> <div id="""" tab1cont style=""""> <div id="""" tab1cont>Illustrated in this DVD are two significant evolutions in our skill-building sequences for Backstroke:<br> <br> (1) An expedited path to whole stroke. While our freestyle drill sequence includes more than 10 steps, our new sequences for each stroke will have you swimming the whole stroke in just four to five steps. This will allow swimmers to more quickly begin integrating what they’ve been learning in whole-skill practice.<br> <br> (2) A more “organic” path to whole stroke. Our motivation for developing new sequences was a desire for every drill step to have clear relevance to the whole-stroke and for our sequences for all strokes to better match the seamless steps by which we teach Freestyle.<br> <br> Also featured in this DVD:<br> <br> 1) Live lesson with Terry Laughlin –Terry demonstrates and explains every step, what it contributes to the overall skill and how it relates to other skills in the sequence. It’s like having a personal lesson with Terry.<br> 2) Beneath the Surface –These segments were shot in a current pool, with both camera and swimmer stationary, allowing for lengthy study of the movements. We shot these segments from six different underwater and surface angles, including directly underneath and overhead. No instructional video has ever examined the strokes so thoroughly.<br> 3) TI Coaches Practice – Watch TI coaches practice the key drills and the whole stroke, also from multiple angles. Also shows examples of “imperfect” skills illustrating likely stroke and drill errors to watch out for.<br> 4) For Boomers – This section, never before included in any instructional video shows how to adapt your swimming to be better than ever in middle age. Though you may not be as strong or as supple as you were at 25, like Terry you can still swim your best by following the tips in this section.</div></div></div>     </div>

<li>Snap one end of the Strap to one side of the Pod. Either end of the  Strap can connect to either end of the Pod, but the Pod should have the  Wahoo Fitness logo facing up when in use.</li>
<li>Wrap the Strap around your back and snap the free end to the free  side of the Pod so that the Pod is located on your breastplate, just  below your breasts. Adjust the Strap to create a snug, yet comfortable  fit.</li>
<li>Once in place, move within 5’ - 10’ of any device that receives Bluetooth Smart wireless data, such as the iPhone 4S and<span> iPhone 5</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><br><strong>How do I pair my Blue HR using the Wahoo Fitness App?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Wahoo Fitness App</li>
<li>Tap the wrench icon in the top right for settings</li>
<li>Choose Workout Settings</li>
<li>Select the Workout Type</li>
<li>Choose Add Sensor</li>
<li>Select <span class=""il"">HR</span></li>
<li>It should start searching for the <span class=""il"">HR</span>. You might also see the BT logo flash.</li>
<li>Click Save in the top right</li>
</ol>
<p><br><strong>It won't connect! What do I do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not get a reading, or the readings are erroneous, ensure  that the electrodes are wet, have good contact with your skin and the  that your Heart Rate Sensor is sufficiently snug. Your Heart Rate Sensor  ‘sleeps’ with inactivity and ‘awakens’ with good electical contact. A  brief physical warm up may be required.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>How do I pair it with my device?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each Sensor has a unique identification code and can be uniquely  paried with a display device or reader so that it will always be  recognized when it is activated and within range. Since each reader is  unique, you should reference the instructions of your reader for pairing  techniques.</li>
<li>Make sure the Bluetooth setting on your device is turned on and that you have latest version of your favorite compatible app. </li>
<li>Pair the heart rate strap in the app, not in Bluetooth settings.   In the wahoo app, it is under quick settings and then either pair  new sensor (if you don't have a paired <span class=""il"">hr</span> strap yet) or heart rate. You can pair the strap there.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>How do I change the battery?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battery is located behind a cover on the back of your Heart Rate  Sensor Pod and can be replaced by placing a coin in the slot and  turning the cover 1/4 turn counterclockwise. Replace with a 3 volt  CR2032 battery (contact a local waste handling group for proper disposal  of old battery).</li>

<p>Stop counting laps. Let Garmin do the math with Garmin Swim. It’s the swimming watch designed for pool¹ use that tracks your distance, pace, stroke count and more.</p>
<h3>Strap It On and Dive In</h3>
<p>Garmin Swim is ready to go right out of the box – just tell it the size of the pool you’re swimming in and begin your workout. Its sleek profile allows it to cut right through the water, so it won’t slow you down.

<h3>Focus On Your Training</h3>
<p>With Garmin Swim on your wrist, you can focus on your technique instead of what lap you’re on. It automatically knows the stroke you’re using and tracks your lengths, strokes, distance, pace and more. With a few button presses, you can also log drills or start timed intervals without constantly monitoring the pool clock. It even calculates your swolf score to help you gauge your swimming efficiency, making it ideal for lap swimmers of all levels. The intuitive interface utilizes 6 exterior buttons, so each and every function can be accessed quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Stay Motivated</h3>
<p>Slim and attractive enough to be worn as a daily watch, Garmin Swim serves as a personal reminder of your goals. To help you stay motivated, it displays your weekly accumulated distance under the time of day. Watch features include dual time zones and alarm.</p>

<h2 class=""Pro_Detail_Left_Line"">FAQ:</h2>
<strong>How does iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor work?</strong><br> The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor is a fully automatic arm cuff blood                             pressure monitor that uses the oscillometric principle to measure your systolic,                             diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. The monitor works with the free iHealth                             MyVitals app that has personalized health tools to help you get the most out of                             your data and to better manage your health goal.                             <br> <br> <strong>How accurate is the iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor?</strong><br> The iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor has obtained CE medical certification                             (Europe) as well as FDA approval (USA). The monitor also has obtained ESH Certification                             (European Society of Hypertension).<br> <br> <strong>Why home monitoring is a great way to track blood pressure?</strong><br> Home monitoring is a great way to help detect and monitor high blood pressure. Regular                             readings taken over a period of time can track the history of your results and indicate                             any changes, fluctuations or elevations in your blood pressure. An individual high                             reading is not necessarily an indication of hypertension or other health issue.                             iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor provides a convenient way to test, track                             and share your results.                             <br> <br> <strong>What is iHealth Cloud and how to access it?</strong><br> Upon setting up your app user account, you will also have access to a free, secure                             iHealth cloud service account where all of your data is backed up and stored securely.                             Go to www.ihealthlabs.com, then click on ""Sign in"" to access your cloud service                             account using your app login name and password. You can log in to the cloud from                             anywhere and anytime to access your data, regardless of where the measurement was                             taken.                             <br> <br> <strong>Can the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor be used with more than one iPhone, iPad or                                 iPod touch?</strong><br> Yes, you can use the Blood Pressure Monitor with as many different iPhones, iPads                             or iPod touches as you wish. Just install the iHealth MyVitals app on each device                             you intend to use with the monitor.                             <br><br> <strong>Can I set up the app so multiple users can use the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor?</strong><br> Yes. You can set up multiple accounts in the iHealth MyVitals app. Then choose the                             desired user before each reading. <br><br> <strong>Can measurements be taken without an iOS device?</strong><br> Yes. You can enable the offline measurement in the “Device Settings” of iHealth                             MyVitals app. To start measurements when disconnected from the iOS device (“offline”),                             turn on the Monitor by pressing the “START/STOP”button. Offline measurement data                             will be uploaded to the device automatically upon the next iOS connection</div>
